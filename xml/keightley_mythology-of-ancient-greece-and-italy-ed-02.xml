        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p rend="noindent"><hi rend="sc">This</hi> new edition of the Mythology of Greece and Italy
          is properly speaking a new work. Few pages or even paragraphs remain unaltered, and nearly
          two-thirds of it are new matter, or have been rewritten. The causes of this change (of
          which I think an explanation is due) are as follows. The work was originally intended to
          be a mere school-book, and it was commenced on that plan ; circumstances caused it to be
          continued on another, and to be completed on a third ; hence the inequality in it which
          every one must have observed. Further, it was written at such hours as I could withdraw
          from other literary avocations, and with but a moderate apparatus of books ; hence the
          errors in facts, as I did not always recollect to verify what I had written from perhaps a
          bad edition of a classic author. Finally, I was only a learner when I aspired to become a
          teacher ; and though I had attained to correct principles, I had not acquired the habit of
          applying them with readiness and accuracy.</p>
        <p>Considering these real defects, and that the work was by an author who was little known,
          and on a subject against which there was rather a prejudice, and that it appeared during
          the very height of the Reform fever, when few could think of the calm pursuit of
          literature, it may be said to have had more success than could have been reasonably
          anticipated. The praises which it has received from Mr. Thirlwall and other competent
          judges have naturally given me much gratification ; for as they must have been well aware
          of its defects, it is plain that they thought them to be more than compensated by its
          merits.</p>
        <p>Of the present Edition I think I may venture to speak with <pb n="p. iv"/>more
          confidence. It is the result of my reading for the last six years, during which I have
          gone through the whole of the Greek and Latin classics with a view to it ; and I can
          assert with truth that there are very few of the references in the following pages which I
          have not made myself directly from the originals. It will also be found to contain the
          results of the inquiries of those eminent scholars whose works are so frequently referred
          to, my obligations to whom I at all times most cheerfully acknowledge. Should it chance to
          come under the eye of any of them, and should he happen to find his ideas anywhere adopted
          without a reference to his work, I trust he will have the candour to impute the omission
          to inadvertence rather than to design.</p>

        </quote>
        <p rend="noindent">so I may say of myself, it was necessity, not any idle visions of fame
          that led me to make literature my profession ; for had I been free to choose, I had
          certainly trodden the <hi rend="i">fallentis semita vitœ.</hi> Engaged however in the
          literary career, my first thought was how I might at the same time promote my own
          interest, and render some service, however trifling, to my country, that it might be said
          of me, <hi rend="i">Haud inutiliter vixit.</hi> It appeared to me that histories of a
          better kind than the compilations of Goldsmith were wanting in our schools, and I felt
          that I could supply the deficiency. The event has more than justified my anticipation ;
          and the adoption of my books at Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester, and most of the other
          great public schools, besides a number of private ones, immediately on their appearance,
          proved, I may say, their merit ; for to nothing else can it be justly ascribed. I have
          thus the satisfaction of thinking that I shall be instrumental in impressing correct ideas
          in history and politics on the minds of those who will be future legislators, or occupy
          other important stations in society.</p>
        <p>The present work is of a different character ; its object is to keep up and extend the
          taste for classic literature, which <pb n="p. v"/>in my opinion tends so strongly to
          refine, and at the same time to invigorate the intellect, but which I sometimes fear is
          rather on the wane in this country. Its size and necessary price (the present containing
          more by a fifth than the former edition) are perhaps insuperable impediments to its
          general adoption in schools ; but I should hope that it will continue to be used in the
          Universities, and that in schools the reading of it will be recommended to, though not
          enjoined on, the higher classes. I think I may speak with some confidence of the
          correctness of the narratives : it must be of advantage to know the opinions of the
          leading scholars of the continent ; and as to my own, as I advance them without dogmatism,
          I can see them rejected without displeasure. I confess I wish to entice as many as
          possible into the pleasing regions of mythology, for I know from experience how delightful
          it is to escape at times from the dull realities of the actual world, and lose one's self
          in the enchanted mazes of primeval fiction.</p>
        <p>In selecting Mythology I took possession of a field which lay totally unoccupied. This
          can hardly be said of any other part of classic literature, but many may be better
          cultivated than they have been hitherto. Thus the private life of the ancient Greeks and
          Romans may be more fully elucidated. That of the latter people I intend to make the
          subject of a future work ; the former has for many years engaged the attention of my
          friend Mr. St. John, whose enthusiasm for Greece far exceeds mine ; and his work, when it
          appears, will, I am confident, be found to contain a vast store of curious knowledge, and
          will prove a valuable aid to the classic student.</p>
        <p>The reader will observe that I employ the Greek terminations <hi rend="i">us</hi> and <hi
            rend="i">on</hi> in mythic names instead of the Latin <hi rend="i">us</hi> and <hi
            rend="i">um.</hi> There is no good reason for this last usage, and I think Greek names
          should be so written as that they might be at once transferred to the original Greek
          characters. For this purpose the long <hi rend="i">e</hi> and <hi rend="i">o</hi> should
          be marked as they are in the Index, and if we were to use <hi rend="i">k</hi> instead of
            <hi rend="i">c</hi> before <hi rend="i">e</hi> and <hi rend="i">i</hi>, writing for
          instance <hi rend="i">Kimôn</hi> and <hi rend="i">Kephalos</hi> instead of <hi rend="i"
            >Cimon</hi> and <hi rend="i">Cephalus</hi>, it would be all the better.</p>
        <pb n="p. vi"/><p>The subjects of the plates are all genuine antiques, chiefly taken from
          the <hi rend="i">Galérie Mythologique.</hi> The <hi rend="i">errata</hi>, which I have
          carefully marked, are I think very few considering the bulk and nature of the work. In
          this praise however I claim no share ; it all belongs to the printers, to whom also
          belongs the praise or blame of the peculiarities in orthography or grammar.</p>
        <p>The following digression will I hope be excused. It is on a subject — that of literary
          property — in which, from the nature of my works, I feel myself interested. As our silence
          is made an argument against us, it becomes every author to take an opportunity of
          expressing his sentiments on it. The following are mine.</p>
        <p>No fallacy can be greater than that of supposing that the public have any rights in this
          matter unless it be the right of the stronger, according to</p>
        <quote>
          <l>the simple plan,</l>
          <l>That they should take who have the power,</l>
          <l>And they should keep who can.</l>
        </quote>
        <p rend="noindent">A literary work, whether the creation of genius, like Waverley, or the
          product of toil and patient industry, like the present, is I conceive property in the
          fullest sense of the word, as much so as lands or houses. To these last the public have a
          right, but it is only on giving the full value of them, and on the principle that private
          feelings and interests are not to stand in the way of the public good. But this principle
          does not apply in any way to literature. What, we may ask, is to be derived from Waverley
          and such books ? Simply amusement ; and it surely seems very absurd to say that the public
          has a right to be amused, to which right those of individuals must give way. It is very
          much as if the public were to insist on admission to theatres and exhibitions on its own
          terms, the principle of the O. P. riots of our younger days. No man, be it observed, will
          be the worse statesman, lawyer, or physician for not having read Waverley, so that the
          plea of public utility cannot be urged. Even in books of instruction I deny any right in
          the public. Supposing (a most improbable event) <pb n="p. vii"/>that the study of
          mythology should ever become general, the public would have no right to <hi rend="i"
            >my</hi> book except on my own terms. The legitimate course, if these were exorbitant,
          would be to get some one to write a cheaper and better work on the subject, and thus
          punish cupidity while respecting the rights of property.</p>
        <p>I am far however from expecting that full justice will be done us by the legislature. We
          are a small and a disunited party. It cannot be said of us</p>
        <quote>

        </quote>
        <p rend="noindent">Our enemies are numerous ; the booksellers have caused printers,
          book-binders, etc. to petition against us ; the newspaper press is, with a few honourable
          exceptions, arrayed against us ; the political œconomists, who will sacrifice anything,
          how sacred soever, on the altar of their idol, misnamed Utility, are opposed to us ; and
          the diffusion of knowledge, the march of intellect, the public good, and similar specious
          phrases, enable legislators to perpetrate injustice under the show of patriotism and
          public spirit.</p>
        <p>I do not think that the great publishing houses can be properly classed among our
          opponents. They have no objection to the extension of the period of copyright provided the
          author be empowered to transfer all his rights to <hi rend="i">them</hi>, and that any
          extension of the term of those copyrights which they have purchased should go to <hi
            rend="i">them</hi> also, and not to the author. Theirs indeed is but too often the
          lion’s share, as I know by my own experience. For the Outlines of History in Lardner's
          Cyclopædia I received only 130<hi rend="i">l.</hi>, and if I am not greatly misinformed,
          that sum bears little proportion to what the proprietors have already made by it, and the
          copyright has yet twenty years to run. I applied in vain for some small share in the
          gain ; it was contrary I was told to the rules of trade. Nay, when they wanted me to write
          another work, likely to be as popular, they said they could not afford to give more than
            150<hi rend="i">l.</hi> ! I mention these facts not out of ill-will to the <pb
            n="p. viii"/>proprietors, some of whom are the publishers of most of my other works, but
          simply to let the world see how inadequate is the remuneration sometimes received by the
          authors of even the most successful works.</p>
        <p>I would say then, as the publishers say they would not give more for a long than for a
          short term of copyright, let the public be the gainer ; and if an author has parted, or
          will part, with his copyright, let it become common property at the end of his life, or of
          the twenty-eight years. Otherwise the great publishers will be almost the only gainers by
          a change in the law ; for most authors <hi rend="i">will</hi> transfer to them all their
          rights if they have the power to do it.</p>
        <p>For my own part, I view the question with tolerable indifference, as even under the
          present law I know how to extend my copyright. My books, thank Heaven and the liberality
          of the gentlemen at whose office they are printed, are my own. When the booksellers had
          refused the present work, <hi rend="i">they</hi> enabled me to give it to the world, and
          thus lay the foundation of a moderate independence ; and in that our first transaction
          originated a friendship which nothing I am confident will dissolve but that event which
          terminates all human relations. Another friend, Mr. Brooke, was equally liberal with
          respect to the plates ; and should mythology ever become popular by means of this work,
          they surely are entitled to share in the praise.</p>

        <p>Page 136. — Neither of the derivations given of the name Artemis appears to be
          satisfactory. The following may seem perhaps to come nearer to the truth. Artemis is <hi
            rend="i">quasi</hi> Althemis or Aldemis or Ardemis, from ἄλ<hi rend="i">θω</hi>῎ ΑΛ∆Ω
            (<hi rend="i">ἀ</hi>λ<hi rend="i">δαίνω</hi>), <hi rend="i">to nourish</hi> or <hi
            rend="i">cause to grow</hi>, or ἄ<hi rend="i">ρδω, to water</hi> and thence <hi rend="i"
            >to nourish.</hi> This perfectly unforced etymology accurately accords with the moon,
          whose influence on vegetation and growth in general the ancients held to be so very
          considerable (see p. 194, <hi rend="i">note</hi>
          <hi rend="sup">b</hi>), and which they regarded as the mother of dews (p. 61). Another
          name of the goddess may have been ἡ ἀλ<hi rend="i">θέоυσυ</hi>, ἀλ<hi rend="i">δέоυσα</hi>
          or <hi rend="i">ἀρδέоυσα</hi>, and <hi rend="i">θ</hi> and <hi rend="i">ϕ</hi> being
          commutable (as <hi rend="i">θὴρ, ϕ</hi>ὴρ), the name may have become ἀλ<hi rend="i"
            >ϕείоνσα</hi>, etc., to which Αλ<hi rend="i">ϕειὸѕ</hi> (ἀλ<hi rend="i">θειὸѕ the
            nourisher</hi>) would correspond as a masculine power, and therefore an appropriate name
          for a river. Altheusa it is plain might easily become Arethusa. Possibly too Εἰλ<hi
            rend="i">είθνια</hi> (p. 194), which has the form of a <hi rend="i">perf. part.</hi>,
          may have come from <hi rend="i">ἠ</hi>λ<hi rend="i">θηνîα</hi>, or some word of similar
          form and signification.</p>
        <p>Page 284. — The names of the water-deities seem to be all expressive of the qualities and
          powers of the sea. Nereus is the <hi rend="i">Flower</hi> (from <hi rend="i">νάω</hi>) ;
          Tritôn the <hi rend="i">Wearer-away</hi> (from <hi rend="i">τρύω, tero</hi>) ; Amphitrite
          is nearly the same ; Proteus is <hi rend="i">quasi</hi> Ploteus (from <hi rend="i"
            >π</hi>λώ<hi rend="i">ω</hi>), the <hi rend="i">sailor</hi> or <hi rend="i"
          >swimmer</hi> ; Glaucos plainly denotes the colour of the sea ; Palæmôn was probably in
          its origin Halæmôn, and the change was made after the institution of the Isthmian
          games.</p>
        <p>Page 339. — The notion of regarding the sun and the earth under a conjugal relation, by
          which we have explained the mythe of Niobe, <pb n="p. x*"/>was, we find, a favourite one
          with our elder poets. See Phin. Fletcher, Purple Island, c. ix. st. 1 ; Idem, Pisc.
          Eclogues, v. 2 ; G. Fletcher, Christ’s Victory, i. 37 ; Cowley, The Gazers ; Idem,
          Parting, last stanza. The original seems to have been Sidney's Arcadia, which commences
          thus : — «It was in the time that the earth begins to put on her new appareil against the
          approach of her lover, and that the sunne runing a most even course becomes an indifferent
          arbiter between the night and the day.» Perhaps the idea was suggested to Sidney by Psalm
          xix. 5. Tasso in his Rime Amorose (canz. viii. 25), has</p>
        <quote>
          <l>«Rose dico e viole,</l>
          <l>A cui madre è la Terra e padre il Sole ;»</l>
        </quote>
        <p rend="noindent">and in his note on it he says, «È detto ad imitazione del Pontano.» In a
          work named ‘Tales of an Indian Camp,’ which seems to be not a work of mere fiction, the
          chief Tecumseh says (vol. iii. 234), «The Sun is my father and the Earth is my mother, and
          I repose on her bosom.» It would therefore seem that the view of nature on which we have
          explained the mythes of Attis and Cybele, and of Amphiôn and Niobe, is one pretty
          generally diffused.</p>
        <p>Page 359. — Though we could not perhaps satisfactorily prove it, we have a strong notion
          that Geryoneus (from <hi rend="i">γηρύω</hi>) is only another form of Hades. They both, we
          may observe, had herds of oxen, and the two-headed dog of the former answers to the
          three-headed dog of the latter. Admetos, apparently another form of Hades (p. 122), was
          also famous for his herds. We find the herds of Hades (p. 360) pasturing under the care of
          Menœtius, near those of Geryoneus in the isle of Erithyia, and (p. 363) we meet them in
          the under-world under the care of the same herdsman. This looks very like two different
          forms of the same legend ; the hero in the one seeking the abode of Hades in the west, in
          the other in the under-world. The name Geryoneus might correspond in signification with
            <hi rend="i">κλυτὸѕ</hi> and <hi rend="i">κλύμενοѕ</hi>, epithets of Hades.</p>
        <p>Page 394. — Butes (Β<hi rend="i">ούτηѕ</hi>, i. e. <hi rend="i">βότηѕ</hi>, from BOΩ <hi
            rend="i">βόσκω, to feed</hi>) is the <hi rend="i">Herdsman</hi>, and is the same as
          Hermes. The name of his wife, we may observe (see p. 381), is Chthonia. He was probably to
          the Athenians what Hermes was to the Arcadians, and the two deities were united in the
          usual manner.</p>

        <p>The practice of swearing by the Juno is alluded to by Javenal ; when, lashing the
          unnatural effeminacy of some of the Roman nobles, he says (ii. 98), «Et per Junonem domini
          jurante ministro.»</p>
        <p>The name Juno is contracted from Jovino, as <hi rend="i">prudens</hi> is from <hi
            rend="i">pro videns.</hi></p>
        <p>Page 517. — It appears to us to be quite erroneous to suppose that the Ceres, Liber and
          Libera of the Romans were the Demeter, Dionysos and Kora of the Greeks, by whom Dionysos
          does not seem to have been united with the two goddesses, as Liber was at Rome. We would
          propose the following hypothesis on the subject.</p>
        <p>The temple usually called that of Ceres at Rome was in reality one of the three conjoined
          deities (Liv. iii. 55. Dionys. vi. 17. 44. Tac. Ann. ii. 49). It stood at the foot of the
          Aventine and belonged to the plebeians, to whom it seems to have been what the Capitoline
          temple was to the patricians. In this latter was worshiped a Triad, — Minerva, Jovis,
          Jovino (Juno), i. e. Wisdom, and the God and Goddess <hi rend="i">κατ՚ἐξοχὴν</hi> ; in the
          latter there was also adored a Triad, — Ceres, Liber, Libera. May we not then suppose,
          that as the priestly nobles, the patricians, adored a triad of celestial or mental
          deities, so the agricultural plebeians worshiped a triad of deities presiding over the
          fruits and products of the earth ? From the employment of the plural (<hi rend="i"
          >να</hi>ών, <hi rend="i">ναοὺѕ</hi>) by Dionysius we may further infer that the temple at
          the Aventine contained three <hi rend="i">cellœ</hi> like that on the Capitoline.</p>
        <p>Page 522. — The critics seem to be unanimous in regarding the Pater Matutinus of Horace
          (Serm. ii. 6, 20) as Janus ; for which they are certainly not to be blamed, the poet
          himself having set them the example. To us however this appears to be an error, though as
          we see a very ancient one. The Latin language abounds above all others in adjectival
          terminations (see Hist. of Rome, p. 4), many of which are perfectly equivalent. Such were
          those in <hi rend="i">us</hi> and <hi rend="i">inus. Libertus</hi> and <hi rend="i"
            >Libertinus</hi> were, there is no doubt, originally the same. Valerius was Corvus or
          Corvinus ; Postumius was Albus or Albinus ; the cognomina Luscinus, Græcinus, Calvinus,
          Longinus, Lævinus, etc., were probably equivalent to Luscus, Græcus, Calvus, etc. In the
          latter centuries of the republic the preference seems to have been given to the
          termination in <hi rend="i">inus</hi>, and hence we meet with Censorinus and Marcellinus.
          If these observations be correct, Matutinus is the same as Matutus, and is not Janus, i.
          e. the Sun, but a male deity answering to Matuta, the goddess of the dawn.</p>

                In the time of Pindar it had acquired the signification in which it is here
                employed.</note>, or various popular traditions and legendary tales, current among a
              people and objects of general belief.</p>
            <p>These mythes are usually the fabulous adventures of the imaginary beings whom the
              people worship ; the exploits of the ancient heroes of the nation ; the traditions of
              its early migrations, wars, and revolutions ; the marvellous tales of distant lands
              brought home by mariners and travellers ; and the moral or physical allegories of its
              sages and instructors.</p>
            <p>The legends which compose a nation’s mythology may be divided into two classes. The
              first will contain the true or fabulous <hi rend="sc">Events</hi> which are believed
              to have occurred either among the people itself, as its own adventures, and those of
                <pb n="2" xml:id="p2"/>its princes and heroes, and which may therefore be called <hi
                rend="i">domestic</hi> ; or those of ancient or distant nations, handed down by
              tradition or brought home by voyagers, and these we may entitle <hi rend="i"
                >foreign.</hi> The second class will consist of <hi rend="sc">Doctrines</hi> or
              articles of popular belief, and will comprise the earliest attempts of man to account
              for the various phænomena of the heavens and the earth, and the changes which appear
              to have taken place among them. These last are however, in the popular mode of viewing
              them, as much events as the former, as they were propounded by their inventors in the
              historic or narrative form.</p>
            <p>The wonderful is usually a component part of mythology. The deities of popular belief
              are very frequent actors in its legends, which differ from ordinary tales and fables
              in this circumstance, and in that of their having been at one time matters of actual
              belief.</p>
            <p>Mythology may therefore be regarded as the depository of the early religion of the
              people. It also stands at the head of their history, for the early history of every
              people, with whom it is of domestic origin, is mythic, its first personages and
              actions are chiefly imaginary<note place="bottom">See the author’s History of Greece,
                p. 9.</note>. It is only gradually that the mist clears away, and real men and deeds
              similar to those of later times begin to appear ; and the mythic period is frequently
              of long duration, the stream of history having to run a considerable way, before it
              can completely work off the marvellous and the incredible.</p>

            <head><hi rend="i">Origin of Mythology</hi>.</head>
            <p>It is an interesting but by no means an easy task to trace out and explain the
              various causes and occasions that have given origin to the different legends which
              form the mythology of a people, such as the Greeks for example, with whom it is rich
              and complicated. We regard the following as the most probable mode of accounting for
              their existence.</p>
            <p>Polytheism, or the belief in a number of beings of a nature superior to man, and who
              can be of benefit or injury to him, seems congenial to the human mind. It is always
              the <pb n="3" xml:id="p3"/>religion of unenlightened tribes, and even in lettered and
              polished nations it still retains its hold upon the minds of the weak and the
                ignorant<note place="bottom">The belief in fairies and similar beings, for example,
                among the common people in various countries. See the ‘Fairy Mythology,’ <hi
                  rend="i">passim.</hi></note>. An appearance so general can only be the result of
              some law of the mind ; and those who have directed their attention to the language and
              ideas of man, in different stages of culture, will probably concede that there is a
              law which impels the human mind to ascribe the attribute of intelligence to the
              efficient cause of natural phænomena, particularly those which are of rare occurrence.
              The less the mind is expanded by culture, the more powerful is the operation of this
              law ; and while the philosopher ascribes all effects to <hi rend="i">one</hi> great
              intelligent cause, and usually views not so much Him as the secondary unintelligent
              causes which He employs, — the simpler children of nature, who cannot rise to so just
              and elevated a conception, see <hi rend="i">multitude</hi> where he contemplates <hi
                rend="i">unity</hi>, and numerous intelligent causes actively engaged in producing
              the effects which he refers to one single mind. Either then the true idea of One God
              has been resolved by the vulgar into that of a plurality ; or the numerous deities of
              the people have been by the philosopher reduced to one, possessed of the combined
              powers of all ; or, which is more probable, rather we may say is the truth, both
              hypotheses are true : man commencing with the knowledge of one God, gradually became a
              polytheist ; and philosophy, slowly retracing the steps of error, returned to the
              truth which had been lost.</p>
            <p>It is utterly impossible to fix historically the date of the rise of polytheism among
              any people. Supposing, for the sake of hypothesis, a race to have been from some
              unassignable cause in a state of total or partial ignorance of the Deity, their belief
              in many gods may have thus commenced. They saw around them various changes brought
              about by human agency, and hence they knew the power of intelligence to produce
              effects. When they beheld other and greater effects, independent of and beyond human
              power, they felt themselves, from the principle we have already stated, invincibly
              impelled to ascribe their production to some unseen being, similar but superior to
              man. Thus when the thunder rolled <pb n="4" xml:id="p4"/>and the lightning flamed
              along the sky, the terrified mortal regarded them as sent forth by a god who ruled the
              heavens ; when the sea rose in mountains and lashed the shore or tossed the bark, the
              commotion was referred to a god of the sea ; the regular courses, the rising and the
              setting of the sun and moon, appeared to him plainly to indicate the presiding care of
              peculiar deities ; the rivers which flowed continuously, which swelled and sank, must
              be under the control of intelligences ; and trees at regular seasons put forth and
              shed their foliage beneath the care of unseen deities<note place="bottom">See Völcker,
                Myth. der Jap. 253, 254.</note>. In this manner all the parts of external nature
              would have become animated ; and the thoughts of courage, wisdom, and love, which
              involuntarily rise in the soul of man, and the ready eloquence which at times flows
              from his lips, being referable to no known cause, would be attributed to the unseen
              working of superior beings<note place="bottom">Hom. II. i. 55. with Wolf's note. Od.
                v. 427. See also II. ix. 459.</note>.</p>
            <p>Man is incapable of conceiving pure spirit, and he knows no form so perfect or so
              beautiful as his own, and none so well adapted to be the vehicle of mind<note
                place="bottom">Aristotle, Pol. i. 3.</note>. He naturally, therefore, fell into the
              habit of assigning a human form to his gods ; but a human form divested of weakness
              and imperfection, and raised to his highest ideal of beauty, strength and power, yet
              still varying according to the character and occupation of the deity on whom it was
              bestowed. Thus the Grecian votary viewed manly strength and vigour as the leading
              attributes of the god who presided over war and inspired daring thoughts ; while in
              the god of archery and music beauty and strength appeared united, and dignity and
              majesty of mien and countenance distinguished the father of gods and men and ruler of
              heaven.</p>
            <p>These deities, so like to man in form, were held to exceed him far in power and
              knowledge, but to be, like him, under the influence of passion and appetite. They had
              their favourites and enemies among mankind, were gratified by prayers and offerings,
              and severely punished slight, neglect or insult. They dwelt in celestial houses, but
              similar in form <pb n="5" xml:id="p5"/>to those of man ; and, like man, they stood in
              daily need of food and repose. Chariots drawn by horses or other animals of celestial
              breed conveyed them over earth, sea, and air ; their clothing and arms were usually of
              the form of those of mortals, but of superior workmanship and materials<note
                place="bottom">See the minute description of Hera dressing herself in Homer, II.
                xiv. 170 <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. The gods were not, strictly speaking,
              eternal : they were born, according to most systems of mythology ; and some, at least,
              assigned a period to their duration.</p>
            <p>In the eyes of their worshipers these gods had each his distinct personal existence
              and sphere of action. The Greek, for example, fully believed that Helios, the Hindoo
              that Surya, guided the course of the sun each day. When, therefore, we shall in future
              speak of gods of the sea, the sun, the moon, we would not be understood to mean <hi
                rend="i">personifications</hi> of these objects. In truth, a personification of the
              sea or sun is not a very intelligible expression. We mean by these gods, deities
              presiding over and directing them, but totally distinct from them ; <hi rend="i"
                >regents</hi> of them, in the sense in which the archangel Uriel is by Milton called
              the regent of the sun. Personification properly accords only with qualities and
              attributes ; and we shall in our progress meet with a class of deities, such as
              Mischief, Strife, Prayers, which are strictly speaking such.</p>
            <p>When a people had thus formed for themselves a System of gods so like to man, and yet
              ruling over the world, it was natural that a body of mythes, or legends of their
              adventures, and of their dealings with mankind, should gradually arise ; and as they
              passed from hand to hand, receive various embellishments and additions, till what was
              at first but a mere dry assertion or conjecture became a marvellous or an agreeable
              tale. It is the opinion of one of the ablest mythologists of the present day, that
              there is a certain stage in the culture of a people in which the mythic is the natural
              mode of representation, to which men are led by a kind of necessity, and in which they
              act almost unconsciously. He gives as an instance the pestilence in the commencement
              of the Ilias. Allowing, he says, the carrying away captive of the daughter of Chryses
              and the <pb n="6" xml:id="p6"/>pestilence itself to be actual and real facts, all
              those who heard of them, and who had at the same time a firm belief in the avenging
              power of Apollo, whose priest Chryses was, would pronounce, with as full conviction as
              if it had been something which they had seen and experienced themselves, that it was
              the god who had sent the pestilence on the prayer of his priest<note place="bottom"
                >Müller, Proleg. 78. 111, 112, and elsewhere.</note>. How far this theory is well
              founded, and whether it will apply with equal force to other mythologies as to that of
              Greece, is a question which we will not now discuss.</p>
            <p>The sources, or the occasions of the production, of mythes may, we think, be arranged
              under the following heads, which fall into two classes, namely, of <hi rend="i"
                >things</hi> and of <hi rend="i">names.</hi></p>
            <p>1. The sages of remote antiquity appear to have had a peculiar fondness for
              enveloping moral and physical truths in the garb of symbol, mythe, and allegory ; and
              the legends which they thus devised form no inconsiderable portion of the various
              bodies of mythology.</p>
            <p>2. As a second source may perhaps be added the pride of family and the flattery of
              poets, which would seek to cast lustre on the origin of some noble house by placing a
              deity at the head of its pedigree, or to veil the transgression of one of its
              daughters by feigning that a god had penetrated the recesses of her chamber, or met
              her in the wood or at the fountain. Legends of this kind are to be placed among the
              latest. Indeed we very much doubt if this be a real original source of mythes<note
                place="bottom">The earliest allusion to this practice we have met with is in Eurip.
                Bac. 26.</note>, and we place it here only because it has been generally so
              regarded.</p>
            <p>3. A great number of legends in all countries are indebted for their origin to the
              extreme desire which men have to assign a cause for the various phænomena of the
              natural world. The Scandinavian mythology is full of instances, and the subsequent
              pages will present them in abundance. We cannot however refrain from giving in this
              place the following instance, as it combines the ancient and modern legendary
              explanations of the same natural appearance.</p>
            <p>It is well known that most of the rivers of the Peloponnese have their sources in
              lakes situated in the high valley-plains <pb n="7" xml:id="p7"/>of Arcadia, which are
              so completely shut in by mountains that the streams leave them by subterranean
              passages, called by the ancient Arcadians <hi rend="i">Zerethra</hi> (ζέρεθρ<hi
                rend="i">α</hi>, i. e. βέθρ<hi rend="i">α</hi>), and by the moderns <hi rend="i"
                >Katavóthra.</hi> The plain of the district of Pheneos had two of these passages
              piercing the surrounding mountains, one of which gives origin to the river Ladôn. On
              the rocky faces of two of the hills, which advance into the plain, at a height of
              about fifty feet, runs a line, below which the colour of the rocks is lighter than it
              is above. The natural, though probably incorrect inference is, that the waters stood
              one time at that height. The ancient Arcadians said that Apollo, incensed at Hercules’
              having carried off the tripod from Delphi and brought it to Pheneos, inundated the
              valley, and that Hercules formed the chasms by which the waters ran off<note
                place="bottom">Paus. viii. 14. 2. Plut. de Sera Numinis Vindicta, 12. Catull.
                lxviii. 109.</note>. Others said that Hades carried off the daughter of Demeter
              through one of these chasms under Mount Cyllene<note place="bottom">Conon. Narrat. 15.
                It is not quite certain, however, that it is of these chasms he speaks.</note>. The
              moderns account for the origin of the chasm by the following legend. Two devils once
              possessed the lake : they dwelt on opposite sides of it, and were continually
              quarrelling ; a furious contest at length took place between them on the top of Mount
              Sactá, whose base was washed by the lake. The devil who lived on the west side adopted
              the ingenious expedient of pelting his adversary with balls of ox-fat, which sticking
              to his body and there taking fire, annoyed him beyond measure. To free himself from
              this inconvenience, the worsted fiend plunged into the lake and dashed through the
              side of the mountain Sactá, thus forming the passage through which the waters flowed
              off and left the plain dry<note place="bottom">Leake's Travels in the Morea, iii.
                148.</note>.</p>
            <p>To this head may be referred the practice of the Greeks to assign the origin of
              animals and plants to transformations effected by the power of the gods, a practice of
              which we shall have to record numerous instances<note place="bottom">We meet an
                instance even in Homer, Od. xix. 518.</note>. Even in the Mohammedan East examples
              of this procedure (which was probably learned from the Greeks) are to be found ; the
              origin of the <pb n="8" xml:id="p8"/>rose is ascribed to the Prophet<note

              lover of the fair Shîrîn<note place="bottom">Malcolm, Sketches of Persia, ii.
                98.</note>. Many changes in the natural world have also been effected by the Saints,
              according to the popular creed in most parts of Europe.</p>
            <p>4. The desire to account for the phænomena of the moral world has also led to the
              invention of legends. Thus the laws of Mena explain the difference of castes in India,
              by saying that the Bramins, that is the priests, were produced from the mouth of
              Bramah ; the warriors from his arms ; the traders from his thighs ; the Parias, or
              lowest class, from his feet. The poor Laplanders account for the difference between
              themselves and their more fortunate southern neighbours by the following legend. The
              Swede and the Laplander, they say, were brothers in the beginning, but when there came
              on a storm the former was terrified, and sought shelter under a board, which God
              caused to become a house, but the latter remained without ; whence ever since the
              Swede dwells in a house, while the Laplander lives in the open air<note place="bottom"
                >Geijer, Svea Rikes Häfdar, i. 417.</note>.</p>
            <p>5. Many legends have arisen from the necessity of giving some account of the
              invention of arts and implements, and of assigning a cause for traditionary ceremonies
              and observances, the memory of whose true origin had been lost. The festival of the
              Hyacinthia at Sparta, for example, originally it would seem celebrated in honour of
                Demeter<note place="bottom">Müller, Dor. i. 373.</note>, was probably indebted for
              its name to the flower Hyacinthos ; and the legend of the boy beloved by Apollo was a
              later fiction. The Fasti of Ovid will present instances of the application of this
              principle, and in the following pages we shall have occasion to notice it.</p>
            <p>The second class of legends will come under the three following heads.</p>
            <p>6. The epithets of gods, when their true origin was unknown or had been lost, were
              usually explained by some legend. Of this practice also we shall meet with instances
              as we proceed ; for the present we will content ourselves with a single example.</p>
            <pb n="9" xml:id="p9"/><p>In the island of Samos stood a temple dedicated to the Gaping
              Dionysos, of whose origin the following legend was related. A Samian named Elpis,
              having made a voyage to Africa, saw as he was one day on the seashore a huge lion
              approaching him with his mouth wide open. In his terror he uttered a prayer to
              Dionysos and fled to a tree, up which he climbed. The lion came and laid himself at
              the foot of the tree with his mouth still open, as if he required compassion, and
              Elpis saw that a bone was stuck fast in his teeth which prevented him from eating ; he
              took pity on him, and came down and relieved him. As long as the ship stayed on the
              coast the grateful lion brought each day a portion of the produce of his hunting, and
              Elpis on his return to Samos built a temple to the Gaping Dionysos<note place="bottom"
                >Plin. H. N. viii. 16. 56.</note>.</p>
            <p>7. Casual resemblance of sound in words, and foreign, obsolete or ambiguous terms,
              were another abundant source of legends. In Greek <hi rend="i">λáaς</hi> is a <hi
                rend="i">stone</hi>, and <hi rend="i">λαòς a people</hi> ; hence the legend of
              Deucaliôn and Pyrrha restoring the human race by flinging stones behind them<note
                place="bottom">Pind. Ol. ix. 68 <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> cum Schol. Apollod. i. 7.
                2.</note>. There was a place at Rome called <hi rend="i">Argiletum</hi> : this word,
              which evidently signifies a place abounding in potter's earth (<hi rend="i"
                >argilla</hi>)<note place="bottom">Varro L. L. p. 44. (Bip.)</note>, may be divided
              into two words (<hi rend="i">Argi letum</hi>), signifying <hi rend="i">death of
                Argus</hi> ; and hence arose a legend noticed by Virgil<note place="bottom">Æn.
                viii. 345. Servius <hi rend="i">in loc.</hi></note>. A part of the province of
              Seistân in Persia is named Neem-rôz, <hi rend="i">i. e. half-day</hi> ; and the
              popular tradition is, that it was once covered by a lake, which was drained by the <hi

              But, as the writer from whom we have taken this legend justly observes, Neem-rôz is
              also <hi rend="i">mid-day</hi> ; a term which, in several languages, denotes the <hi
                rend="i">south</hi> ; and Neem-rôz lies due south of Balkh, the first seat of
              Persian dominion. To return home, there is a point of land between Hastings and
              Pevensey, on the coast of Sussex, called Bulverhithe ; that is, plainly,
              Bulver-landing-place, such being the meaning of the old word <hi rend="i">hithe.</hi>
              But as this term has gone out of use, the <pb n="10" xml:id="p10"/>honest fishermen
              there will gravely tell you, that when William the Conqueror, after landing in
              Pevensey-bay, was advancing to Hastings, on coming to this place he took a <hi
                rend="i">bull’s hide</hi> and cut it into thongs, which he tied together, resolving
              to halt and give battle at the spot where the line he made of them should terminate.
              These instances may suffice to show the generality of this principle.</p>
            <p>8. Finally, metaphorical language understood literally may have given occasion to
              many legends. Thus cause and effect, and other relations, are in various languages,
              particularly the Oriental, expressed by terms of kindred. The Hebrews termed sparks,
                <hi rend="i">sons of the burning coal</hi> ; one who is to die, a <hi rend="i">son
                of death.</hi> The Arabs call a traveller, a <hi rend="i">son of the way</hi> ; a

                >daughters of the eye</hi> ; and dreams, <hi rend="i">daughters of night</hi> : an

                phraseology is still employed in the south of Europe. Sancho Panza is in Don Quixote

            <head><hi rend="i">Theories of the Origin of Mythology</hi>.</head>
            <p>The theory already given appears to us to be the one which most simply and
              satisfactorily explains the origin of by far the greater portion of the legends of
              mythology : but, both in ancient and modern times, theories of a different kind have
              been advanced, and supported with much ingenuity and learning. The ancient systems we
              shall notice when treating of the progress of Grecian mythology ; in this place we
              will enumerate those which have been most prevalent in modern times. These may, we
              think, be divided into three classes : the Historic, the Philosophic, and the
              Theological.</p>
            <p>1. <hi rend="sc">The Historic</hi> : according to which all the mythic persons were
              once real human beings, and the legends are merely the actions of these persons
              poetically embellished. The chief maintainers of this hypothesis are Bochart<note
                place="bottom">Canaan and Phaleg.</note> and Bryant<note place="bottom">Analysis of
                Heathen Mythology.</note>, who see in the Grecian mythes the true history of the
              personages of Sacred Scripture ; Rudbeck<note place="bottom">Atlantica.</note>, who
              regards them as being drawn from the history of the North of Europe ; the Abbé
                Banier<note place="bottom">Mythologie et Fables expliquées par l’Histoire.</note>,
              who maintains that Grecian mythology is Egyptian and Grecian history in a poetic
              dress. Banier's countrymen, Larcher, Clavier, Raoul-Rochette, and others have of late
              years supported this theory, and it has been maintained by Böttiger<note
                place="bottom">See Amalthea, i. 12. Ideen zur Kunst-Mythologie, ii. 7.</note> in
              Germany.</p>
            <p><hi rend="sc">II. The Philosophic</hi> : which supposes mythology to be merely the
              poetical envelope of some branch of human science. The illustrious Bacon<note
                place="bottom">De Sapientia Veterum.</note> exercised his ingenuity in deriving
              ethical and political doctrines from some of the Hellenic mythes. Their concealed

            <p><hi rend="sc">III. The Theological</hi> : which assigns mythologya higher rank ;
              regarding it as the theology of polytheistic religions, and seeking to reduce it to
              harmony with the original monotheism of mankind. Vossius endeavours to show that the
              fables of heathenism were only a distortion of the revelations made to man by the true
              God ; and, at the present day, Görres, Creuzer and others<note place="bottom">Lobeck
                terms these writers <hi rend="i">synchytic</hi> mythologists, «who think that the

              and other countries, and regarding the East as the original birthplace of mythology,
              employ themselves in tracing the imagined channels of communication ; and as they
              esteem every legend, ceremony, usage, vessel, and implement to have been symbolical,
              they seek to discover what truth, moral, religious, or philosophical lies hid beneath
              its cover. These men are justly denominated <hi rend="i">Mystics</hi><note
                place="bottom">«Mystieism is an irregular mixing and confounding of feelings and

              a highly coloured figurative style, and a certain vague magnificence appears to
              envelope their conceptions, — all calculated to impose on the ignorant and the
                unwary<note place="bottom">It is remarkable enough that the German mystic
                mythologists have either embraced Popery or shown a strong tendency toward
                it.</note>. It is against this system that we are most anxious to warn and guard our
              readers. In our eyes it is disgusting from its indelicacy as well as its absurdity ;
              it approaches the confines of impiety, and at times seems even to pass them. The study
              and adoption of it can hardly fail to injure the intellectual powers, and to produce
              an indifference toward true religion. <pb n="13" xml:id="p13"/>In fact, if the theory
              of these men be true, the necessity for Christianity becomes a question<note

                Görres, Schelling, Sickler, and other writers of this school, to read as a sure
                antidote the Antisymbolik of Voss, and the Aglaophamus of Lobeck.</note>.</p>
            <p>Of these three classes the last alone is peculiar to modern times : the two former
              theories were, as we shall presently see, familiar to the ancients. We must also
              observe, that all are true to a certain extent. Some mythes are historical, some
              physical, some moral, some theological ; but no single one of these theories will
              suffice to account for the whole body of the mythology of any people. Some of them,
              too, apply more to one system than another : the Scandinavian mythology, for example,
              is of a more physical character than the Grecian : the Indian is more metaphysical
              than either the Grecian or the Scandinavian.</p>
            <p>The mythologies which offer the widest fields for inquiry are those of ancient
              Greece, of India, and of Scandinavia. To these may be added that of ancient Egypt.
              Italy has left no mythology, properly speaking, though for the sake of uniformity we
              so denominate the account of its deities and religion given in the present work. The
              Persian cycle, which is preserved in the Shâh-nâmeh of Ferdoust, is purely heroic ;
              and the Celtic tribes of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands had also a small heroic
              cycle, of which Cuchullin, Fingal, Gaul, Oscar, and other personages whose names are
              familiar to the readers of the pseudo-Ossian are the heroes<note place="bottom">In the
                author's ‘Tales and Popular Fictions,’ chap. iv., will be found some account of the

                the same place with some remarks on Ossian.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is chiefly to the explanation of the rich and elegant mythology of Greece that

              and necessary knowledge. The scholars of the North, especially the learned Finn
              Magnusen, have exerted themselves, and not without success, in developing the true
              nature and character of the venerable mythology of their forefathers, especially on
              the physical theory. For the mythology of India philosophy has as yet done but
              little ; it has been the sport of the wildest mysticism, and has led to the
              degradation of those of other countries. The Asiatic Researches, and the works of
              Polier, Ward and some others, with the various translations that have been made from
              the Sanscrit, present a large mass of materials to the inquirer. Jablonski and Zoega
              have laboured diligently in the field of Egyptian mythology.</p>

              <hi rend="i">Rules for the Interpretation of Mythes</hi>. </head>
            <p>The following rules should be attended to in mythological inquiries.</p>
            <p>1. To consider the mythology of each people separately and independently, and not to
              suppose any connexion between it and any other till both have been examined minutely
              and carefully, and so many points of resemblance have presented themselves as to leave
              no doubt of the original identity of the systems<note place="bottom">Völcker, Myth.
                der Jap. pp. vi. vii.</note>. It is to the neglect of this rule that we owe so much
              of the absurdity to be found in the works of many mythologists, and nothing has tended
              more to the bringing of the science of mythology into neglect and contempt. The
              ancient Greeks were led from ignorance to give credit to the cunning priesthood of
              Egypt, and to believe that they had received their religion from that country ; and it
              is but too well known how, in our own days, Sir William Jones and his followers have
              been deceived by their own imaginations, and the impostures of artful pundits, in
              their efforts to connect the religions of Greece and India.</p>
            <p>2. In like manner the mythes themselves should be considered separately, and detached
              from the system in which they are placed ; for the single mythes existed long before
              the <pb n="15" xml:id="p15"/>system, and were the product of other minds than those
              which afterwards set them in connexion, not unfrequently without fully understanding
                them<note place="bottom">Buttmann, Mytholog. i. 155.157. Müller, Proleg. 218, 219.

            <p>3. We should pay particular attention to the <hi rend="i">genealogies</hi> which we
              meet with in mythology, as they frequently form the key to the meaning of a mythe, or
              even of a whole cycle<note place="bottom">Völcker, Myth. der. Jap.<hi rend="i"
                  >passim.</hi> Müller, Proleg. 274, <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. Great caution
              however should be used in the application of this rule, or it may lead us into error
              and absurdity if carried beyond its legitimate bounds.</p>
            <p>4. The same or even greater caution is required in the application of <hi rend="i"
                >etymology</hi> to this subject<note place="bottom">Müller, Proleg. 232.</note>. If
              applied judiciously it will at times give most valuable results ; if under no guidance
              but that of caprice and fancy, it will become the parent of all sorts of monsters and
                <hi rend="i">lusus naturæ.</hi></p>
            <p>5. Finally, though we should never pronounce a mythe which we have not examined to be
              devoid of signification, we should not too confidently assert that every mythe <hi
                rend="i">must</hi> have an important meaning, for certainly some have been but the
              creation of capricious fancy<note place="bottom">Völcker, however, asserts positively
                that there is no mythe without a meaning. Myth. der Jap. 50. This may be true, but
                the meaning is often a very trifling one.</note>. On these occasions it would be
              well to bear in mind the following words of Johnson : «The original of ancient
              customs,» says he, «is commonly unknown, for the practice often continues after the
              cause has ceased ; and concerning superstitious ceremonies, it is vain to conjecture,

              the words <hi rend="i">bear in mind</hi>, for if adopted as a principle it will only
              serve to damp ardour and check inquiry. The rule should be, — this mythe most probably
              has a meaning, but it is possible it may not have one.</p>

            <p rend="noindent"><hi rend="sc">The</hi> remote antiquities of Greece are involved in
              such total obscurity, that nothing certain can be adduced respecting the origin of the
              people or their mythology. Reasoning from analogy and existing monuments, some men of
              learning venture to maintain, that the first inhabitants of that country were under
              the direction of a sacerdotal caste, resembling those of India and Egypt ; but that
              various circumstances concurred to prevent their attaining to the same power as in
              those countries. In the Homeric poems, however, by far the earliest portion of Grecian
              literature, we find no traces of sacerdotal dominion ; and in the subsequent part of
              our work we shall bring forward some objections against this hypothesis<note
                place="bottom">See Müller, Proleg. 249-253. Min. Pol. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is certainly not improbable that these ancient priests, if such there were, may
              have had their religion arranged systematically, and have represented the various
              appearances and revolutions of nature under the guise of the loves, the wars, and
              other actions of these deities, to whom they ascribed a human form and human passions.
              But the Grecian mythology, as we find it in the works of the ancients, offers no
              appearance of a regular concerted system. It is rather a loose collection of various
              images and fables, many of which are significant of the same objects.</p>
            <p>The ancient inhabitants of Greece were divided into a great variety of little
              communities, dwelling separately, parted in general by mountains and other natural
              barriers. As they were naturally endowed with a lively imagination, there gradually
              grew up in each of these little states a body of tales and legends. These tales of
              gods and heroes were <pb n="17" xml:id="p17"/>communicated by wandering minstrels and
              travellers from one part of the country to another. Phœnician mariners probably
              introduced stories of the wonders of the East and of the West, which in those remote
              ages they alone visited ; and these stories, it is likely, were detailed with the
              usual allowance of travellers’ licence. Poets, a race indigenous in the favoured clime
              of Hellas, caught up the tales, and narrated them with all the embellishments a lively
              fancy could bestow ; and thus at a period long anterior to that at which her history
              commences, Greece actually abounded in a rich and luxuriant system of legendary lore.
              This is proved by the poems of Homer and Hesiod, which, exclusive of the ancient
              legends they contain, make frequent allusion to others ; some of which are related by
              subsequent writers, and many are altogether fallen into oblivion.</p>
            <p>These poems also bear evident testimony to the long preceding existence of a race of
              poets, — a fact indeed sufficiently evinced by the high degree of perfection in the
              poetic art which they themselves exhibit. Modern mythologists have therefore been
              naturally led to the supposition of there having been in ancient Greece <hi rend="i"
                >aœdic</hi> schools, in which the verses of preceding bards were taught, and the art
              of making similar verses was acquired<note place="bottom">Wolf, it is well known, held
                this opinion. The Schools of the Prophets among the Hebrews were evidently of the
                same nature.</note>. One of the ablest of our late inquirers<note place="bottom"
                >Völcker, Myth. der Jap. p. 5. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Böttiger, Ideen zur
                Kunst-Myth. ii. 50. See also Müller, Proleg. 219.</note> is of opinion that the
              original seat of these schools was Pieria, at the northern foot of Mount Olympos. He
              has been led to this supposition by Heyne's remark, that Homer always calls the Muses
                <hi rend="i">Olympian</hi>, which remark he extends by observing that the Homeric
              gods are the Olympian, and no others. In this however we can only see that, as we
              shall presently show, Olympos was in the time of Homer held to be the seat of the
              gods. It does not appear to us that any one spot can be regarded as the birth-place of
              the Grecian religion and mythology ; they were, like the language and manners of the
              people, a portion of their being ; and the <pb n="18" xml:id="p18"/>knowledge of the
              origin of the one is as far beyond our attainment as that of the other.</p>
            <p>The Greeks, like most of the ancient nations, were little inclined to regard as mere
              capricious fiction any of the legends of the different portions of their own race or
              those of foreign countries. Whatever tales they learned, they interwove into their own
              system ; taking care, however, to avoid contradiction as far as was possible. When,
              therefore, they found any foreign deities possessing the same attributes as some of
              their own, they at once inferred them to be the same under different names ; but where
              the legends would not accord, the deities themselves were regarded as being different,
              even when they were in reality perhaps the same.</p>
            <p>«This,» says Buttmann<note place="bottom">Mythologus, i. 24. Welcker, Tril.
                95.</note>, «was the case when they found traditions of other kings of the gods whom
              they could not reconcile with their own Zeus, and of queens who could not be brought
              to agree with their Hera. But a new difficulty here presented itself ; for they could
              not assume several kings and queens reigning at one time. The ancients appear to me to
              have gotten over this difficulty by saying, that those gods had indeed reigned, but
              that they had been overcome by their Zeus ; and that the goddesses had indeed
              cohabited with Zeus, but they had not been his lawful wives. And this, if I mistake
              not, is the true origin of the tale of the Titans being driven out of heaven, and of
              the concubines of Zeus, who were reckoned among the Titanesses, the daughters of
              Heaven, and among the daughters of the Titans, such as Metis, Themis, Leto, Demeter,
              Dione, who were all, according to different legends, spouses of Zeus.»</p>
            <p>With these views of this most ingenious writer we agree, as far as relates to the
              consorts of the Olympian king, each of whom we look upon as having been his sole and

            <p>The poets having taken possession of the popular legends, adorned, amplified, added
              to them, and sought to reduce the whole to a somewhat harmonious system<note
                place="bottom">Müller, Proleg. 212.</note>. They however either studiously abstained
              from departing from the popular faith, or were themselves too much affected by all
              that environed them to dream of anything which might shock the opinions of their
              auditors. Accordingly we may be certain that the mythes contained in Homer and Hesiod
              accord with the current creed of their day, and are a faithful picture of the mode of
              thinking prevalent in those distant ages.</p>
            <p>As knowledge of the earth, of nature, her laws and powers, advanced, the false views
              of them contained in the venerable mythes of antiquity became apparent. The educated
              sometimes sought to reconcile tradition and truth ; but the vulgar still held fast to
              the legends hallowed by antiquity and sanctioned by governments<note place="bottom"
                >Buttmann, Mythol. i. 45. Müller, Proleg. 171. In Lucian (De Luctu, 2.) may be seen
                a convincing proof of how firmly the vulgar, even in his time, clung to the old
                notions.</note>. A prudent silence therefore became the safest course for those who
              exceeded their contemporaries in knowledge.</p>
            <p>The philosophers of Greece early arrived at the knowledge of one only God, the
              original cause and support of all. Anaxagoras is said to have been the first who
              openly taught this truth ; and he was in consequence charged with atheism, and
              narrowly escaped the punishment of death. Philosophers took warning, and truth was no
              longer brought into public view. But such is the nature and connection of things, so
              profuse the resemblances which the world presents to view, such is the analogy which
              runs between the operations of mind and those of matter, that several of the mythes
              afforded the philosophers an opportunity of holding them forth as the husks in which
              important moral or physical truths were enveloped ; in which in reality many such
              truths had been studiously enveloped by ancient priests and sages<note place="bottom"
                >Müller, Proleg. 66, 99. Welcker, Tril. 89.</note>.</p>
            <p>After an intercourse had been opened with Asia and Egypt, <pb n="20" xml:id="p20"
              />mysteries came greatly into vogue in Greece. In these it is thought<note
                place="bottom">This is the theory of Voss. We share the doubts of Lobeck (Aglaoph.
                1295.) respecting its soundness. The Exegetes, or guides, were more probably the
                persons who gave explanations of this kind to strangers.</note>, but perhaps not
              with sufficient evidence, the priests who directed them used, for the credit of the
              popular religion whose reputation they were solicitous to maintain, to endeavour to
              show its accordance with the truths established by the philosophers, by representing
              them as being involved in the ancient mythes, which they modified by the aid of
              fiction and forgery so as to suit their purposes.</p>
            <p>About this time, also, the system of <hi rend="i">theocrasy</hi> (<hi rend="i"
                >θεοκραία</hi>), or mixing up, as we may call it, of the gods together, began to be
                employed<note place="bottom">Lobeck, Aglaoph. 78, 79, 614, 615. Müller, Proleg.
                91.</note>. It was thus that the wine-god Dionysos was made one with the sun-god
              Helios, and this last again, as some think, with the archer-god Phœbos Apollo. As we
              proceed we shall have frequent occasion to notice this principle.</p>
            <p>While in the schools of the philosophers, and the temples devoted to the mysteries,
              the ancient legends were acquiring a new and recondite sense, another class of men,
              the artists, had laid hold of them. The gods of their forefathers were now presented
              under a new guise to the Greeks, who, as they gazed on the picture or the statue, saw
              the metaphors of the poets turned to sense, and wings, for example, adorning those
              deities and mythic personages to whom the poet had in figurative style applied the
              expression <hi rend="i">winged</hi> to denote extraordinary swiftness<note
                place="bottom">Voss, Myth. Br. <hi rend="i">passim.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>The poets soon began to regard the ancient legends as mere <hi rend="i"
                >materials.</hi>The belief in their truth having in a great measure vanished, the
              poets, especially the later dramatists, thought themselves at liberty to treat them in
              whatever manner they deemed best calculated to produce the meditated effect on the
              feelings of their audience<note place="bottom">Müller, Proleg. 89-91, 209. Orchomenos,

              pleasure ; ideas imported from Egypt were <pb n="21" xml:id="p21"/>mixed up with the
              old tales of gods and heroes ; and the <hi rend="i">fable</hi> to be represented on
              the stage often varied so much from that handed down by tradition, that, as is more
              especially the case with Euripides, the poet appears at times to have found it
              necessary to inform his audience in a long prologue of what they were about to
              witness.</p>
            <p>Such was the state of the ancient mythology of Greece in her days of greatest
              intellectual culture. Few of the mythes remained unaltered. Priests, philosophers, and
              poets combined to vary, change, and modify them. The imagination of these various
              classes produced new mythes, and the local tales of foreign lands were incorporated
              into the Grecian mythic cycle.</p>
            <p>When the Ptolemies, those munificent patrons of learning, had assembled around them
              at Alexandria the scholars and the men of genius of Greece, the science of antiquity
              was, by the aid of the extensive royal library, assiduously cultivated ; and the
              ancient mythology soon became a favourite subject of learned investigation. Some
              worked up the mythes into poems ; others arranged them in prose narratives ; several
              occupied themselves in the explication of them.</p>
            <p>At this time what is named <hi rend="i">Pragmatism</hi>, or the effort to reduce the
              mythes to history, began greatly to prevail<note place="bottom">Müller, Proleg. 97-99.
                Lobeck, Aglaoph. 987. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Buttmann, i. 197.</note>. It is
              probable that this took its rise from the Egyptian priests, who, as we may see in
              Herodotus, represented their gods as having dwelt and reigned on earth<note
                place="bottom">Herodotus, ii. 144.</note>. Hecatæus of Miletus, one of the earliest
              Grecian historians, would seem to have laboured to give a rational form to the old
                legends<note place="bottom">Hecatæus began his work in these words : «I write as it
                appears to me to be true ; for the narratives of the Hellenes are very various and
                ridiculous, as it seems to me.»He said that Cerberos was a serpent that lay at
                Tænaron.</note>; and we may observe in the explanation given by Herodotus, after the
              Egyptian priests, of the legend of the soothsaying pigeon of Dodona, and in other
              places of that historian, a similar desire<note place="bottom">Herod. ii.
                54-57.</note>. This mode of rationalising was carried to a much greater extent by
              Ephorus : but the work which may be regarded as having contributed by far the most to
              give it vogue, <pb n="22" xml:id="p22"/>was the Sacred History (Ἱ<hi rend="i">ϵρὴ</hi>
                Ἀ<hi rend="i">ναγραфή</hi>) of Euhemerus, which was so celebrated in antiquity that
              we shall here stop to give a brief account of it<note place="bottom">The chief remains
                of this work are to be found in the fifth book of Diodorus (12. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi>), and in the fragment of the sixth book preserved by Eusebius in his
                Evangelic Preparation. There arc fragments remaining of the Latin translation of
                Ennius ; and the work is frequently referred to by Sextus Empiricus and the Fathers
                of the Church.</note>.</p>
            <p>Euhemerus said, in this work, that having had occasion to make a voyage in the
              Eastern ocean, after several days’ sail he came to three islands, one of which was
              named Panchaia. The inhabitants of this happy isle were distinguished for their piety,
              and the isle itself for its fertility and beauty, in the description of which the
              writer exerted all the powers of his imagination. At a distance of several miles from
              the chief town, he says, lay a sacred grove, composed of trees of every kind, tall
              cypresses, laurels, myrtles, palms, and every species of fruit-tree, amidst which ran
              rivulets of the purest water. A spring within the sacred district poured forth water
              in such abundance as to form a navigable river, named the Water of the Sun<note
                place="bottom">This name is borrowed from the Fount of the Sun (<hi rend="i"
                  >κρήνη</hi> Ἡλ<hi rend="i">ίον</hi>) at the temple of Ammon. Herod. iv.
                181.</note>, which meandered along, fructifying the whole region, and shaded over by
              luxuriant groves, in which during the days of summer dwelt numbers of men, while birds
              of the richest plumage and most melodious throats built their nests in the branches,
              and delighted the hearer with their song. Verdant meads, adorned with various flowers,
              climbing vines, and trees hanging with delicious fruits, everywhere met the view in
              this paradise. The inhabitants of the island were divided into priests, warriors, and
              cultivators. All things were in common except the house and garden of each. The duty
              of the priests was to sing the praises of the gods, and to act as judges and
              magistrates : a double share of everything fell to them. The task of the military
              class was to defend the island against the incursions of pirates, to which it was
              exposed. The garments of all were of the finest and whitest wool, and they wore rich
              ornaments of gold. The priests were distinguished by their raiment of pure white
              linen, and their bonnets of gold tissue.</p>
            <pb n="23" xml:id="p23"/><p>The priests derived their lineage from Crete, whence they
              had been brought by Zeus after he had succeeded his predecessors Uranos and Kronos in
              the empire of the world. In the midst of the grove already described, and at a
              distance of sixty stadia from the chief town, stood an ancient and magnificent temple
              sacred to Triphylian Zeus, erected by the god himself while he was yet among men ; and
              on a golden pillar in the temple the deeds of Uranos, Zeus, Artemis, and Apollo had
              been inscribed by Hermes in Panchæic letters, which the voyager says were the same
              with the sacred characters of the Egyptian priests. Zeus had, according to this
              monument, been the most potent of monarchs : the chief seat of his dominion had been
              Crete, where he died and was buried, after having made five progresses through the
              world, all whose kings feared and obeyed him.</p>
            <p>The object of Euhemerus in inventing this Utopia, which by the way many navigators
              sought after but no one ever found, was evidently to give a blow to the popular
              religion, and even to make it ridiculous ; for though he seems to have treated some of
              the higher gods, as Zeus for example, with a degree of respect, he was less particular
              with the inferior ones and with the heroes. Thus of Aphrodite he says, that she was
              the first who reduced gallantry to an art, and made a trade of it, that she might not
              appear more wanton than other women<note place="bottom">Ennius <hi rend="i">ap.</hi>

            <p>The work of Euhemerus was vehemently attacked by all who retained a veneration for
              the old religion, and the writer himself was stigmatised as an atheist<note

                138.</note> : but it exerted a great influence over the subsequent historians, as we
              may perceive in the case of Diodorus of Sicily. It was translated into Latin by
              Ennius, of whose work some fragments remain<note place="bottom">«Infidelity was
                introduced by the Calabrian Greek Ennius, and became naturalised as morals

              will suffice to show the degree in which it affected the old Italian mythology<note
                place="bottom">See Æn. vii. 47-49, 177-182 ; viii. 355-359.</note>. Finally, the
              Fathers <pb n="24" xml:id="p24"/>of the Church employed it to advantage in their
              conflicts withe the supporters of the ancient religion.</p>
            <p>While Euhemerus thus fixed on an imaginary island in the Eastern ocean as the
              original abode of the deities adored in Greece, others, among whom Dionysius of Samos
              or Mytilene was the most celebrated, chose the Western coast of Africa for the same
                purpose<note place="bottom">Diodorus, iii. 56. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. For
              this they seemed to have Homeric authority ; as the poet calls Oceanos, whose abode
              was placed in the West, the origin of the gods<note place="bottom">Ὠ<hi rend="i"
                  >κϵανόν</hi> т<hi rend="i">ϵ</hi>‚ <hi rend="i">θϵϖν γένϵσιν καὶ μηέρα</hi> Τ<hi
                  rend="i">ηθύν</hi>. — II. xiv. 201.</note>. According to these writers the coast
              of Ocean on this side, fertile as Panchaia itself, was inhabited by a people named
              Atlanteians, distinguished for their piety and their hospitality to strangers. The
              first king who ruled over them was named Uranos. He collected the people, who had
              previously dwelt dispersedly, into towns, and taught them agriculture, and thus
              reformed their manners. He gradually reduced under his sway the greater part of the
              world. By study of the heavens, and thus learning to foretell the celestial phænomena,
              he obtained the reputation of being of a nature superior to man ; and when he died,
              his people gave him divine honours and named the heavens after him.</p>
            <p>By several wives Uranos was the father of forty-five children, eighteen of whom, the
              offspring of Titaia or Earth, were named Titans. The most distinguished of their
              daughters were Basileia and Rhea, also named Pandora. The former, who was the eldest,
              aided her mother to rear her brothers and sisters, whence she was called the Great
              Mother. She succeeded her father in his dominion ; and after some time she married
              Hyperiôn, one of her brothers, to whom she bore two children, endowed with marvellous
              sense and beauty, named Helios and Selena. But the other Titans now grew jealous, and
              they murdered Hyperiôn, and flung Helios into the river Eridanos, where he was
              drowned. At the tidings Selena, who loved her brother beyond measure, cast herself
              from the roof of the palace and perished. Basileia lost her senses through grief, and
              went roaming in madness through the country with dishevelled locks, beating drums and
                <pb n="25" xml:id="p25"/>cymbals. She disappeared at length in a storm of rain,
              thunder, and lightning. The people raised altars to her as a goddess, and they named
              the sun and moon after her hapless children.</p>
            <p>The Titans then divided the realm of their father among themselves. The coast of
              Ocean fell to Atlas, who named the people and the highest mountain of the country
              after himself. Like his father he was addicted to astronomy ; he first taught the
              doctrine of the sphere, whence he was said to support the heavens. Kronos, the most
              impious and ambitious of the Titans, ruled over Libya, Sicily, and Italy. He espoused
              his sister Rhea, who bore a son named Zeus, in all things the opposite of his grim
              sire ; whence the people, delighted with his virtues, named him Father, and finally
              placed him on the throne. Kronos, aided by the other Titans, sought to recover his
              dominion ; but the new monarch defeated him, and then ruled, the lord of the whole
              world and the benefactor of mankind. After his death he was deified by his grateful
              subjects.</p>
            <p>We will not pursue any further these dreams of the mythographer, for the tasteless
              system never seems to have gained general credit. We therefore proceed to relate the
              further course of the Grecian mythology.</p>
            <p>As we have already observed, the allegorical system of interpretation prevailed at
              the same time with the historical. This mode of exposition was introduced by the
              sophists ; Socrates and Plato occasionally employed it ironically ; but its greatest
              cultivators were the philosophers of the Stoic sect. It was chiefly physical and
              ethical truths that they deduced from the ancient mythes, and they generally regarded
              the gods in the light of personifications of the powers of nature.</p>
            <p>When the Romans became acquainted with Grecian literature, they identified the gods
              of Greece with such of their own deities as had a resemblance to them. Thus Hermes
              became Mercurius, Aphrodite Venus, and the mythes of the former were by the poets, and
              perhaps in the popular creed, applied to the latter. As in Greece, some believed, some
              disbelieved in the popular deities, and the former sought the solution of the mythes
              in the schools of philosophy or the temples of the mysteries. The valuable work of
              Cicero ‘On <pb n="26" xml:id="p26"/>the Nature of the Gods’ shows in an agreeable
              manner the ideas entertained on this subject by the most accomplished Romans of his
              time.</p>
            <p>After the conflict had commenced between Heathenism and Christianity, the
              allegorising principle was applied to the former with still greater assiduity than
              heretofore. The New Platonists endeavoured by its aid, in union with Oriental
              mysticism, to show, that the ancient religion contained all that was required to
              satisfy the utmost needs of the human soul. The Fathers of the Church laid hold on the
              weapons thus presented to them, to defend the new and attack the old religion. By the
              aid of the principles of Euhemerus they robbed the gods of Greece of their divinity ;
              by that of the allegorising principle of the Stoics they extracted truth from the
              legends of Greek theology, and discovered mystery in the simplest narratives and
              precepts of the Hebrew Scriptures. Unfortunately in this process many of the mythes
              and practices of Heathenism became incorporated with the pure religion of the Gospel,
              and Christianity also had soon a mythology of its own to display. On the final
              overthrow of Heathenism its mythology slept along with its history and literature the
              sleep of the dark ages ; but at the revival of learning it was eagerly laid hold on by
              poets and artists<note place="bottom">The earliest modern work on this subject is
                Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum, written in the fourteenth century.</note>, and it
              attracted the attention of antiquarians and philosophers. The various theories by
              which it was sought to reduce it to system, which we have already enumerated, were
              then revived or devised ; and mythology forms at present an important branch of
              learning and philosophy.</p>
            <p>Of late years the mythology of Greece has in the hands of men of genius and learning,
              especially in Germany, resumed the simple and elegant attire which it wore in the days
              of Homer and Hesiod, and in which the following pages will attempt to present it to
              the reader.</p>

              <hi rend="i">Literature of the Grecian Mythology</hi>. </head>
            <p>A brief view of the literature of the Grecian mythology, or of the works whence our
              knowledge of it has been derived, <pb n="27" xml:id="p27"/>seems a necessary
              supplement to the preceding sketch of its history.</p>
            <p>The Ilias and the Odyssey, as the two great heroic poems which are regarded as the
              works of Homer are named, are (with the exception of some parts of the Hebrew
              Scriptures) the earliest literary compositions now extant. Their origin is enveloped
              in the deepest obscurity, and the questions whether they are the production of one or
              of many minds, whether they were originally written, or were orally transmitted for
              centuries, have for some years engaged the pens of critics. It seems to be now
              generally agreed that the two poems are the productions of different minds, and that
              in both there are interpolations, some of which are of no small magnitude, but that
              notwithstanding they may be regarded as faithful pictures of the manners and opinions
              of the Achæans or Greeks of the early ages<note place="bottom">In the former edition
                of this work we entered at some length into this subject. We are now aware that it
                is impossible to say anything satisfactory on it in so limited a compass, and
                therefore reserve our materials for the composition of a volume on some future
                occasion. We will here only observe, that besides our general agreement with the
                critics who regard the poems as interpolated, we hold with Wolf the last six books
                of the Ilias to be the work of a different poet from the author of the Ilias in
                general.</note>. Beside the Ilias and the Odyssey, the ancients possessed some other
              narrative poems, which were ascribed, but falsely, to the same author. All these
              poems, however, have long since perished.</p>
            <p>The age of Hesiod is equally uncertain with that of Homer. Three only of the poems
              ascribed to him have come down to us, viz. the didactic poem named Works and Days, the
              Theogony, and the Shield of Hercules. Hesiod was also said to be the author of a poem
              in four books named the Catalogues, or Eoiæ<note place="bottom">Ἠ<hi rend="i"
                  >οίαι</hi>, from the words <hi rend="i">ἢ οἵη, or such as</hi>, with which each
                narrative began. See the commencement of the Shield.</note>, which related the
              histories of the heroines or distinguished women of the mythic ages ; but of this also
              only a few fragments have been preserved. The same is the case with the poems named
              the Melampodia and Ægimios, likewise ascribed to this ancient bard.</p>
            <p>Homer and Hesiod were succeeded by a crowd of poets, who sang all the events of the
              mythic ages. The chief of <pb n="28" xml:id="p28"/>these were Stasinos of Cyprus,
              Arctinos of Miletus, Lesches of Lesbos, Cynæthos of Chios, Eumelos of Corinth, Agios
              of Trœzen, and Eugammôn of Cyrene. Their poems were the Cypria, the Æthiopis, the
              Little Ilias, the Iliupersis or Taking of Ilion, the Nostoi or Returns of the Chiefs,
              the Telegonia, or Death of Odysseus, etc. There were also Heracleiæ, or poems on the
              subject of Hercules, by Peisander, Panyasis, and other poets, a Theseïs on the
              adventures of Theseus, poems on the wars of Thebes<note place="bottom">The Thebaïs was
                ascribed to Homer. In the opinion of Pausanias (ix. 9. 3.) it was next in merit to
                the Ilias and Odyssey. There was another Thebaïs by Antimachus, but written at a
                much later period.</note>, a Titanomachia, an Amazonia, a Danaïs, a Phoronis,
              etc.</p>
            <p>In the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, the critic Zenodotus of Ephesus
              united several of these poems with the Ilias and Odyssey into one whole, commencing
              with the marriage of Heaven and Earth, and ending with the death of Odysseus. This was
              named the Epic Cycle, and it continued to be read during some centuries of the
              Christian æra<note place="bottom">By far the best account of the Epic Cycle, its
                authors and contents, will be found in Welcker's excellent work ‘Der epische
                Cyclus.’ (Bonn, 1835.)</note>. Of this, however, the Homeric portion alone has come
              down to us : for our knowledge of the events contained in the remainder of the Cycle
              we are indebted to the works of the later poets Quintus Smyrnæus, Coluthus, and
              Tryphiodorus, and the various scholiasts or commentators and compilers.</p>
            <p>The lyric succeeded the epic poets. Mythic legends were necessarily their principal
              materials, as their verses were mostly dedicated to the worship of the gods, or the
              praise of victors in the public games, or were sung at banquets or in funeral
              processions. These too have disappeared, excepting a portion of those of Pindar. It is
              much to be lamented, in a mythologic view, that so little remains of Stesichorus of
              Himera.</p>
            <p>The tragedians followed : they took their subjects from the epic poems, and their
              remaining works preserve much mythic lore.</p>
            <p>After the epic poetry had ceased, and writing, by means of the Egyptian papyrus, was
              become more common in Greece, <pb n="29" xml:id="p29"/>a set of writers arose who
              related in succinct prose narratives, arranged in historic order, the various mythic
              legends which formed the Epic Cycle, the Eoiæ, and other poems of the same nature. The
              principal of these writers were Pherecydes, Acusilaüs, and Hellanicus ; of <hi
                rend="i">their</hi> works also only fragments remain.</p>
            <p>The historians, Herodotus, Thucydides, and their followers, occasionally took notice
              of the mythic legends. Ephorus and Theopompus were those who devoted most attention to
              them, as their fragments still remaining show.</p>
            <p>The sophists and philosophers employed the mythic form as the vehicle of their
              peculiar systems and ideas. Such was Prodicus’ beautiful fiction of the Choice of
              Hercules, and Protagoras’ story of Prometheus and his brother<note place="bottom"
                >Plato, Protagoras, p. 320.</note>.</p>
            <p>We are now arrived at the Alexandrian period. In this the mythes were treated in two
              different ways. Lycophrôn, Euphoriôn, Apollonius, Callimachus, and the remainder of
              the Pleias, as they were named, formed poems from them ; while Apollodorus, following
              Pherecydes, and adding the fictions of the tragedians, framed a continuous narrative,
              of which an epitome alone has come down to us ; and Crates, Aristarchus, and the other
              editors of the ancient poets gave the legends a place in their commentaries.</p>
            <p>The Latin poets of the Augustan age drew largely on the Alexandrian writers, after
              whom chiefly they related in their verses the mythic tales of Greece, in general pure
              and unaltered, as appears from the Metamorphoses of Ovid, of whose legends the Greek
              originals can,with few exceptions, be pointed out<note place="bottom">As we proceed we
                shall be careful to do so whenever they can be discovered.</note>. It was also in
              this period that Hyginus wrote the mythological work which we now possess.</p>
            <p>The summaries of Parthenius, Antoninus Liberalis and others contain numerous mythic
              legends, as also do the Scholia, or notes on the classic writers of Greece, especially
              those on Homer, Pindar, Apollonius, and Theocritus ; those of Tzetzes on Hesiod and
              Lycophrôn, and the tedious commentary of Eustathius on Homer. The notes of Servius on
              Virgil are also very valuable in this respect, as likewise is the <pb n="30"
                xml:id="p30"/>Violet-bed<note place="bottom">Ἰ<hi rend="i">ωνία</hi>, or Violarium.
                It forms the first volume of Villoison’s Anecdota Græca.</note> of the empress
              Eudocia. It would be tedious to particularise all the other sources of information,
              for in fact there is hardly a classic writer in either language who does not relate or
              refer to some of the mythic legends of Greece ; even the Fathers of the Church
              contribute to augment our knowledge of the mythic tales of the religion against which
              their literary artillery was directed.</p>
            <p>There is one author of a peculiar character, and whose work is of the most
              interesting nature, we mean Pausanias, who travelled in Greece in the second century
              of the Christian æra, and gathered on the spot the legends of the temples and the
              traditions of the people. He has thus preserved a number of mythic narratives
              unnoticed by preceding writers, which had probably been transmitted from father to son
              from the most remote times.</p>
            <p>If to the sources already enumerated we add the long poem of Nonnus on the adventures
              of Dionysos, we shall have given the principal authorities for the contents of the
              following pages. We have been thus succinct on the present occasion, as it is our
              intention to give a view of the literature of each of the mythic cycles in its proper
                place<note place="bottom">On the subject of this section see Müller, Proleg. 81. <hi

              error ; and by applying to the productions of the remote and infantile periods of
              society the just conceptions of the present day in geography and astronomy, give to
              them a degree of folly and inconsistency with which they cannot justly be charged<note
                place="bottom">We recommend the excellent works of Völcker on the Homeric and Mythic
                Geographies ; and also that of Ukert on the Geography of the Greeks and
                Romans.</note>.</p>
            <p>The earliest view of Grecian cosmology that we possess, is that contained in the
              poems of Homer. Next in antiquity is that of the poems of Hesiod, who flourished
              somewhat later, for he displays a much more extended knowledge of the earth than Homer
              appears to have possessed.</p>
            <p>As navigation and the intercourse with foreign countries increased, just ideas
              respecting the more distant regions became more common among the Greeks, and districts
              were continually reclaimed from fable, and brought into the circuit of truth and
              knowledge. Not to speak of the philosophers and historians, we may discern in the
              poets of each succeeding age the progressively extending knowledge of the real
              character of distant lands. Yet still we must not always expect to find in poets all
              the knowledge of the age they live in ; they love to imitate their predecessors, they
              often are unacquainted with the advance of knowledge, they write for the people, who
              still retain old prejudices. It is thus that in the poets of the Augustan age we shall
              find the Homeric ideas of the universe, just as in some modern poets we may meet the
              Ptolemaïc astronomy and judicial astrology, after both had been exploded.</p>
            <pb n="32" xml:id="p32"/><p>The Greeks of the days of which Homer sings, or rather of
              the poet’s own time, though well acquainted with navigation, do not appear to have
              been in the habit of making distant voyages. The Cretans and the Taphians (a people
              who inhabited some small islands in the Ionian sea) perhaps form an exception. We read
              in the Odyssey of their piracies committed on Egypt and Sidôn<note place="bottom">Od.
                xiv. 248-264, 452 ; xv. 426, 451.</note>, and of their bartering voyages to
                Temesa<note place="bottom">Od. i. 184.</note>, (perhaps the place of that name in
              Italy,) where they exchanged iron for copper. But the great authorities of the Greeks
              respecting foreign lands were probably the Phœnicians, who in the most distant ages
              visited Africa, Spain, and possibly the shores of the Atlantic ; and it is likely
              that, after the fashion of travellers and sailors, mingling truth and fiction, they
              narrated the most surprising tales of the marvels of the remote regions to which they
              had penetrated.</p>
            <p>According to the ideas of the Homeric and Hesiodic ages, it would seem that the <hi
                rend="i">World</hi> was a hollow globe, divided into two equal portions by the flat
              disk of the Earth<note place="bottom">Il. viii. 16. Hes. Th. 720.</note>. The external
              shell of this globe is called by the poets <hi rend="i">brazen</hi><note
                place="bottom">Il. v. 504 ; xvii. 425. Od. iii. 2. Pind. Pyth. x. 42. Nem. vi.

                565.</note>, probably only to express its solidity. The superior hemisphere was
              named Heaven, the inferior one Tartaros. The length of the diameter of the hollow
              sphere is given thus by Hesiod<note place="bottom">Th. 722.</note>. It would take, he
              says, nine days for an anvil to fall from Heaven to Earth ; and an equal space of time
              would be occupied by its fall from Earth to the bottom of Tartaros. The luminaries
              which gave light to gods and men shed their radiance through all the interior of the
              upper hemisphere ; while that of the inferior one was filled with eternal gloom and
              darkness, and its still air unmoved by any wind.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Earth</hi> occupied the centre of the <hi rend="i">World</hi> in the
              form of of a round flat disk, or rather cylinder, around which the <hi rend="i"
                >river</hi> Ocean flowed. Hellas was probably regarded as the centre of the Earth,
              but the poets are silent on this point. They are equally so as to the exact central
              point, but <pb n="33" xml:id="p33"/>probably viewed as such Olympos, the abode of the
              gods. In after times Delphi became the <hi rend="i">navel of the earth</hi><note

                Scandinavians.</note>. The Sea divided the terrestrial disk into two portions, which
              we may suppose were regarded as equal. These divisions do not seem to have had any
              peculiar names in the time of Homer. The northern one was afterwards named Europe<note
                place="bottom">The term Europe first occurs in the Homeridian hymn to the Delian
                Apollo (v. 251), where it is opposed to the Peloponnese and the islands, and
                apparently denotes continental Greece. It would seem therefore to come from <hi

                alone<note place="bottom">Pherecydes (Sch. Apoll. Rh. iv. 1396.) first mentions this
                division into Europe and Asia. We find it even in Isocrates (Panegyr. 48.) and in
                Varro (De L. L. iv. p. 13. Bip.).</note>, was in process of time divided into Asia
              and Libya<note place="bottom">Herod. iv. 37-41.</note>. The former comprised all the
              country between the Phasis and the Nile, the latter all between this river and the

            <p>In the Sea the Greeks appear to have known to the west of their own country southern
              Italy and Sicily, though their ideas respecting them were probably vague and
              uncertain ; and the imagination of the poets, or the tales of voyagers, had placed in
              the more remote parts of it several islands, such as Ogygia the isle of Calypso, Ææa
              that of Circe, Æolia that of Æolos, Scheria the abode of the Phæacians, — islands in
              all probability as ideal and as fabulous as the isles of Panchaia, Lilliput, or
              Brobdingnag, though both ancients and moderns have endeavoured to assign their exact
              positions. Along its southern coast lay, it would appear, the countries of the
              Lotus-eaters, the Cyclopes, the Giants, and the Læstrigonians. These isles and coasts
              of the western part of the Sea were <pb n="34" xml:id="p34"/>the scenes of most of the
              wonders of early Grecian fable. There, and on the isles of the Ocean, the passage to
              which was supposed to be close to the island of Circe, dwelt the Sirens, the
              Hesperides, the Grææ, the Gorgons, and the other beings of fable.</p>
            <p>The only inhabitants of the northern portion of the earth mentioned by Homer are the
              Hellenes and some of the tribes of Thrace. But Hesiod<note place="bottom">Herod. iv.
                32.</note> sang of a happy race, named the Hyperboreans, dwelling in everlasting
              bliss and spring beyond the lofty mountains, whose caverns were supposed to send forth
              the piercing blasts of the north wind<note place="bottom">Ῥ<hi rend="i">ίπαι,
                  blasts</hi>, whence these mountains were named Rhipæans.</note>, which chilled the

              inaccessible either by sea or land. Apollo was their tutelar deity, to whom they
              offered asses in sacrifice, while choirs of maidens danced to the sound of lyres and
              pipes, and the worshipers feasted having their heads wreathed with garlands of the
              god’s favourite plant, the bay. They lived exempt from disease or old age, from toils

              not seem to have navigated the Euxine at this time, though they were doubtless not
              ignorant of it, as Homer names some of the peoples on its southern coast. They must of
              course have regarded it as a portion of the Sea. We have no means of ascertaining
              whether they supposed it to communicate with the Ocean, like the western part of the
              Sea. Of Colchis and Caucasus they seem to have had no knowledge <pb n="35"

            <p>On the eastern side of the earth, close to the stream of Ocean, dwelt a people happy

              along the celestial bridge Bifröst, i. e. the Rainbow. The ideas of the ancient
              Italians and other nations seem to have been similar. Hence we might be led to infer
              that Olympos, the abode of the Grecian gods, was synonymous with Heaven, and that the
              Thessalian mountain, and those others which bore the same name, were called after the

              Homer and Hesiod in which Olympos occurs, will lead us to believe that the Achæans

                often the case with him, by no means bear him out in his theory. Statius is the
                earliest poet who speaks of these gates. (See Thebaïs, i. 158 ; vii. 35 ; x. 1.)
                Nonnus (xxvii. 2.) describes Eôs as opening the gates of the east.</note>, that
              there were doors at the eastern and western extremities of the heaven, through which
              the sun-god and other deities ascended from and went down into the stream of Ocean.
              The celestial luminaries seem rather, according to Homer and Hesiod, to have careered
              through void air, ‘bringing light to men and gods.’ When in after times the solid
              heaven was <pb n="39" xml:id="p39"/>established as the abode of the gods, the
              necessity for these doors was perhaps felt ; and they were accordingly invented by
              those who were resolved to leave nothing unexplained.</p>
            <p>The stars appear to have been regarded as moving under the solid heaven, for they
              rose out of and sank into the Ocean stream. The only ones mentioned by name by Homer
              and Hesiod are the constellations Oriôn, the Bear, the Pleiads, and the Hyads, the
              single stars Boötes or Arcturus, and Sirius, and the planet Venus, which they seem to
              have viewed as two distinct stars, in its characters of Morning-star (<hi rend="i"

              their intercourse with Asia and Egypt had commenced.</p>
            <p>Tartaros was, as we have already remarked, unvisited by the light of day. It was
              regarded as the prison of the gods, and not as the place of torment for wicked men,
              being to the gods what Erebos was to men, — the abode of those who were driven from

            <p>Such were the opinions respecting the world and its parts held by the Greeks of the
              heroic times, and even some ages later. With the advance of knowledge, however, their
              ideas altered, and they began to conceive more justly on these subjects. The voyages
              of the Samians and the Phocæans to the West, and the establishment of the Milesian
              colonies on the shores of the Euxine, and the intercourse thus opened with the
              interior of Asia, led to the supposition that the earth was <hi rend="i">oval</hi>
              rather than round, its greater diameter running east and west<note place="bottom"

                45.</note> derides those who still regarded it as a river. Finally, the change of
              religious ideas gradually affected Erebos, the abode of the dead. Elysion was moved
              down to it as the <pb n="40" xml:id="p40"/>place of reward for the good, and Tartaros
              was raised up to it to form the prison in which the wicked suffered the punishment due

            <p>It may not be uninteresting ere we quit the subject of the cosmology of the ancient

            <p>The origin of the world and the origin of the gods, <hi rend="i">i. e.</hi> cosmogony
              and theogony, are in the Grecian system, as in those of some other nations, closely
              united. The sages of antiquity seem to have had a strong persuasion that, to bring
              creation and similar acts down to the comprehension of tribes led by the senses, it
              was necessary to represent natural agents as living and active persons ; or they felt
              a pleasure in exciting admiration, by the narration of the strange and wonderful
              adventures of beings older and more powerful than mankind<note place="bottom">Müller,
                Proleg. 270.</note>.</p>
            <p>The lively and creative genius of the Greeks seems particularly to have delighted in
              this species of fiction. They loved to represent the origin, the union, and the
              changes of the various parts of nature, under the guise of matrimony and birth (their
              more cheerful system, unlike those of Asia and Scandinavia, excluding the idea of the
              death of a god) ; causes with them becoming parents, effects children, the production
              of an effect being the birth of a divine child.</p>
            <p>Every cosmogonic system commences with a Chaos, or state of darkness and confusion.
              The chief difference among these systems lies in the circumstance that some viewed the
              earth, others the water, as the immediate origin of organised bodies. In Grecian
              cosmogony Homer would appear to have followed the former, for he terms Oceanos the
              origin of all<note place="bottom">Il. xiv. 201.</note>; the latter is the theory
              adopted in the Theogony of Hesiod. Thales and the Ionian school of philosophy followed
              the Homeric cosmogony. In the Timæus of Plato it is said that the offspring of Heaven
              and Earth were Oceanos and Tethys, and that from these sprang Kronos, Rhea, and the
              other deities. This is apparently, however, an attempt at bringing Homer and Hesiod
              into harmony.</p>
            <p>The venerable Theogony of Hesiod is evidently the parent of all the succeeding ones,
              and it is itself but the echo of those of bards of far higher antiquity than the
              Ascræan to whom it <pb n="43" xml:id="p43"/>is ascribed, and who often was ignorant of
              the meaning of what he delivered. We will here relate the portion of it which extends
              from Chaos to the establishment of the empire of Zeus and origin of the gods worshiped
              in Greece.</p>

              Earth, the gloomy Tartaros, and Love. Chaos produced Erebos and Night, and this last
              bore to Erebos Day and Æther.</p>
            <p>Earth now produced Uranos (<hi rend="i">Heaven</hi>), of equal extent with herself,
              to envelope her, and the Mountains and Pontos (<hi rend="i">Sea</hi>). She then bore
              to Uranos a mighty progeny : the Titans ; six males, Oceanos, Coios, Crios, Hyperiôn,
              Iapetos, and the youngest of them Kronos ; and six females, Theia, Rheia (or Rhea),
              Themis, Mnemosyne, Phœbe, and Tethys. She also bore the three Cyclopes, Brontes,

                Hundred-handed alone whom Uranos treated thus. Völcker (Myth. der Jap. 283.) says
                the Titans were also shut up.</note> , who, grieved at his unnatural conduct,
              produced the ‘substance of hoary steel,’ and forming from it a sickle, roused her
              children, the Titans, to rebellion against him : but fear seized on them all except
              Kronos, who lying in wait with the sickle with which his mother had armed him,
              mutilated his unsuspecting sire. The drops which fell on the earth from the wound gave
              birth to the Erinnyes, the Giants, and the Melian nymphs : from what fell into the sea
              sprang Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.</p>
            <p>Earth bore to her other son Pontos the ‘truth-speaking’ Nereus,Thaumas (<hi rend="i"
                >Wonder</hi>), Phorcys, and ‘fair-cheeked’ Keto. <pb n="44" xml:id="p44"/>Nereus had
              by Doris, a daughter of the Titan Oceanos, the fifty Nereïdes or sea-nymphs. Thaumas
              was by Electra (<hi rend="i">Brightness</hi>), another daughter of Oceanos, father of
              the swift Iris (<hi rend="i">Rainbow</hi>), and of the ‘well-haired’ Harpies. Keto
              bore to her brother Phorcys the Grææ, the Gorgons, the Echidna, and the serpent that
              guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides.</p>
            <p>Earth finally bore by Tartaros her last offspring, the hundred-headed Typhoeus, the
              father of storms and whirlwinds.</p>
            <p>The progeny of the Titans was numerous. Oceanos had by his sister Tethys all the
              rivers that flow on the earth, and the Ocean-nymphs, three thousand in number. Theia
              bore to Hyperiôn, Helios (<hi rend="i">Sun</hi>), Selena (<hi rend="i">Moon</hi>), and
              Eôs (<hi rend="i">Dawn</hi>) ; and Phœbe to Coios, Asteria (<hi rend="i">Starry</hi>)
              and Leto. Crios had by Eurybia (<hi rend="i">Wide-strength</hi>), the daughter of
                Pontos<note place="bottom">See v. 239.</note>, Astræos (<hi rend="i">Starry</hi>),
              Pallas, and Perses. To Astræos Eôs bore the winds Zephyros, Boreas, and Notos, and
              Eosphoros (<hi rend="i">Dawn-bearer</hi>), or Morning-star, and the stars of heaven.
              Styx, a daughter of Oceanos, was by Pallas the mother of Envy and Victory, Strength
              and Force ; and Asteria, the daughter of Coios, bore to Perses Hecate.</p>
            <p>The fifth Titan, Iapetos, was by Clymene, a daughter of Oceanos, the father of four
              sons, Atlas, Menœtios, Prometheus and Epimetheus.</p>
            <p>Rhea was united to Kronos, and their offspring were Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Aïdes,
              Poseidôn, and Zeus. Kronos, having learned from his parents, Heaven and Earth, that he
              was fated to be deprived by one of his sons of the kingdom which he had taken from his
              father, devoured his children as fast as they were born. Rhea, when about to be
              delivered of Zeus, besought her parents to teach her how she might save him.
              Instructed by Earth, she concealed him in a cavern of Crete, and gave a stone in his
              stead to Kronos. This stone he afterwards threw up<note place="bottom">It was shown in
                after times in the neighbourhood of Delphi (Hes. Th. 498. Pausanias, x. 24. 6.), the
                legend having been transplanted thither from Crete, its original soil. The whole
                fable seems to have been unknown to Homer, who always speaks of Zeus as the eldest
                son of Kronos.</note>, and with it the children whom he had <pb n="45" xml:id="p45"
              />devoured. When Zeus was grown up, he and the other children of Kronos made war on
              their father and the Titans. The scene of the conflict was Thessaly ; the former
              fought from Olympos, the latter from Othrys. During ten entire years the contest was
              undecided ; at length by the counsel of Earth the Kronids released the Hundred-handed,
              and called them to their aid. The war was then resumed with renewed vigour, and the
              Titans were finally vanquished and imprisoned in Tartaros under the guard of the
              Hundred-handed. The Kronids then, by the advice of Earth, gave the supreme power to
              Zeus, who in return distributed honours and dominion among the associates of his
              victory.</p>
            <p>In this theogony order and philosophical consequence are plainly discernible. We find
              it faithfully adhering to the cosmological ideas above developed<note place="bottom"
                >For the explanation of the Theogony see Hermann, De Antiq. Græcor. Mythologia
                (Opusc. vol. ii. 167. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>), Briefen an Creuzer, and Ueber das
                Wesen und die Behandlung der Mythologie. See also Müller, Proleg.
                pp. 371-379.</note>. Void Space must naturally have been first : Earth, which was to
              occupy the centre of the World ; Tartaros, the lowest and deepest gloom ; and Love,
              the generating principle of life and motion, follow in their due order. As in all
              cosmogonies darkness precedes light, so Erebos and Night, the one the darkness
              beneath, the other that above the earth, succeed, and from them spring Day the lower,
              and Æther the higher light above the earth. Without the intervention of Love, Earth
              now produces the Heaven, which arches over her ; the Mountains, which rise on her
              surface and support the heaven ; and the barren salt Sea. United then by Love with
              Uranos, she gives birth to the Titans, the origins of gods and men, of the celestial
              luminaries, and the fructifying streams.</p>
            <p>The making thunder, lightning, and other celestial phænomena to be children of Heaven
              and Earth might seem to imply a deeper knowledge of physics than can be justly
              assigned to these early ages. The cause, however, was a simple one. Uranos being
              masculine could not produce of himself, and Earth was the only female being that could
              be united with <pb n="46" xml:id="p46"/>him. The Cyclopes, that is the <hi rend="i"
                >Whirlers</hi>,<note place="bottom">Κ<hi rend="i">ύκλωψ</hi>, rendered by Hermann
                  <hi rend="i">Volvulus</hi>, from <hi rend="i">κύκλος</hi>, is a simple, not a
                compound substantive, of the same class with μώλωψ, with Κέρκωψ, Κέκροψ, Πέλοψ,
                &amp;c. Like <hi rend="i">Argiletum</hi> (above, p. 9.), its form admitting of
                decomposition gave origin to the one-eyed giants of the Odyssey, who were also known
                to the author of the Theogony : see v. 143. The three lines following are an
                interpolation.</note>, whose individual names signify Thunder, Lightning, and
              Brightness, or Swiftness, represent one kind of celestial phænomena, and the
              Hundred-handed must therefore be the personifications of another, but what kind is
              more difficult to ascertain. It is, however, probable that they refer to winter, as
              the Cyclopes seem more especially related to summer, and that they are the hail, rain
              and snow of that season : Kottos, that is <hi rend="i">Smiter</hi>, being the hail ;
              Gyes, the <hi rend="i">Furrower</hi>, the rain ; and Briareôs, the <hi rend="i"

                denoting <hi rend="i">weight</hi> and strength.</note>; and they were naturally
              named Hundred-handed, from their acting so extensively at the same moment of time<note
                place="bottom">The above explanation is that given by Hermann (Ueber das Wesen,
                &amp;c. p. 84.). He had given a different one previously (De Myth. Ant. Opusc. ii.
                176.), which he rejected for the present more probable one. Welcker (Tril. 147.)
                understands by the Hundred-handed the <hi rend="i">water.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Of the Titans we shall presently treat at length, and the progeny of Earth and Pontos
              shall be noticed in another place<note place="bottom">See below, chap. xvii. and
                xviii.</note>. There remain therefore only to be considered the beings which sprang
              from the blood of the mutilated Uranos. These are the Erinnyes, the Giants, and the
              Melian nymphs. Productiveness is the consequence of that act, for which analogy would
              incline us to look ; and when we divest our mind of the idea of the Giants given by
              Homer, and which became the prevalent one, we may without difficulty find that they
              simply signify <hi rend="i">Producers</hi><note place="bottom">Γ<hi rend="i">ίγαυτϵѕ,

                Ash-nymphs, from <hi rend="i">μϵλία</hi>. In this last case they might denote the
                production of timber-trees. Hermann renders <hi rend="i">μϵλίαι Cicurinæ</hi>,
                deriving it from the same root with <hi rend="i">μϵι</hi>λ<hi rend="i"
                >ίσσϵιυ</hi>.</note>. The <pb n="47" xml:id="p47"/>Erinnyes offer most difficulty ;
              they may be, as some think, telluric powers<note place="bottom">Völcker, <hi rend="i"
                  >ut sup.</hi>, from <hi rend="i">ἐυ ἔρᾳ υαίϵιυ</hi> (Tzetz, Lyc. 152.), referring
                to Demeter Erinnys. According to Hermann <hi rend="i">ἐριυυύϵѕ</hi> is <hi rend="i"

              of the violators of the order of nature — may have been their original one, and their
              origin have been ascribed to the first violation of filial duty.</p>
            <p>We now proceed to the important mythe of the Titans, and as the view of it given by
              Völcker seems to us to be more correct than any preceding one, we will lay it before
              our readers<note place="bottom">Myth. der Jap. 280. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>The six sons and six daughters of Heaven and Earth above enumerated alone are Titans,
              and the most probable derivation of the name is that which makes it equivalent to <hi

              The germs of all beings afterwards to be formed lie in them, but they are inclosed
              within the earth, and cannot act till Uranos is deprived of his procreative power, and
              Aphrodite is produced. Then the Titans Oceanos and Tethys give origin to the rivers
              and streams of the earth ; from Coios, Crios, Hyperiôn, Theia, and Phœbe spring the
              sun, moon, and other luminaries and light-beings ; and the material world being thus
              completed, Kronos and Rhea give birth to the gods, and Iapetos becomes the father of
                men<note place="bottom"><p>Kronos and Iapetos are joined together by Homer (Il.

              replenished with its fitting inhabitants, the Titans are dismissed, to remain inactive
              in Tartaros.</p>
            <p>The Titan-war therefore could have formed no part of the original mythe. It had its
              origin in the figurative terms <hi rend="i">bind</hi> and <hi rend="i">loose</hi>,
              used to signify the checking and permitting of the <pb n="48" xml:id="p48"/>productive
              powers of the Titans. Homer knows nothing of this war ; he merely says that Zeus
              placed Kronos beneath ‘the earth and barren sea<note place="bottom">Il. xiv.
                202-204.</note>,’ and in him the opposition between the Olympian gods and the Titans
              is merely a local one ; the one being the dwellers of the brilliant Olympos, the other
              the inmates of the gloomy Tartaros<note place="bottom">Il. xv. 224 <hi rend="i">et
                  seq.</hi></note>. Hesiod, who evidently misunderstood the sense of the mythe,
              first gave it the form of a war, and narrated its details in the most splendid
              poetry ; but the contradictions and variations in his narrative give convincing proof
              of its being alien from the ancient cosmogonic mythe. In the hands of the logographers
              and poets, such as Æschylus, the cosmogony becomes the history of a series of
              dynasties, and, contrary to Hesiod, the children of all the Titans, except Kronos and
              Rhea, are counted among the Titans, and set in hostility with the Kronids. Thus
                Pherecydes<note place="bottom">That is, supposing (as there is every reason to do)
                that Apollodorus followed him in his theogony.</note> commences with saying that
              Uranos reigned first, and had by Earth the Cyclopes and the Hundred-handed. He casts
              all these into Tartaros, and then the Titans are born ; who all, except Oceanos<note
                place="bottom">The Titanesses are evidently also to be excepted.</note>, at the
              instigation of their mother, fall on their sire, whom Kronos mutilates. They liberate
              their imprisoned brethren ; but Kronos, to whom the kingdom is given, binds them again
              in Tartaros. Then follows the account of the birth of the Kronids, who by freeing the
              Cyclopes and their brethren win the victory, and the three brothers divide the
              dominions of their father among them by lot<note place="bottom">See Il. xv. 187. <hi
                  rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>The Titan-war, as this critic thinks, had its origin and example in those of Typhôn,
              the Aloeids, and the Giants against the gods. The circumstance of Zeus being termed
              King (though for another reason), the change of the three celestial sovereigns, and
              the mutilation of Uranos, aided in making the mythe take this form. The question how
              Zeus came to the throne was naturally answered by the tale of a revolution and
              hostility between the two classes of gods. Imitation is also everywhere to be traced.
              Zeus is made to mutilate Kronos <pb n="49" xml:id="p49"/>as Kronos did Uranos<note
                place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. iv. 983. Tzetz. Lyc. 761. 869. This however seems to
                be a very late fiction.</note>. The latter hides his children under the earth, the
              former swallows his. Kronos is the youngest child, so is Zeus ; the Titans divide the
              dominion of the world, so do the Kronids. As Kronos devours his children for fear of
              their dethroning him, so something similar is recorded of Zeus<note place="bottom"

                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Ib.</hi> 159. 475. 626. 891.</note>; and in the Ilias an
              attempt of the Olympians to bind Zeus is mentioned, in which Briareôs again comes to
              his aid<note place="bottom">Il. i. 396. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Hermann (Ueber das
                Wesen, &amp;c. 85.) gives the following, more ingenious perhaps than solid,
                explanation of this celebrated mythe. Hera, Poseidôn, and Athena set about binding
                Zeus ; that is, mankind would wish to keep summer always for their agriculture
                (Hera, the earth), their navigation, and their civil institutions and occupations,
                and have no winter. But Thetis, <hi rend="i">the Soother</hi> (<hi rend="i"
                >θέω</hi>), who reduces all strife to peace and order, calls Briareôs up to heaven,
                and men must now give over their thoughts of getting the fine weather into their
                power.</note>.</p>
            <p>There would also appear to have been some other ancient system of the celestial
              dynasties, which assigned the place of Uranos and Gæa to Ophiôn and Eurynome. As this
              last is said to be an Oceanis, and the former name is manifestly derived from the
              symbol for the earth<note place="bottom"> »Ο<hi rend="i">ϕιѕ, a serpent.</hi></note>,
              it would seem to have been one of the systems in which earth and water were regarded
              as the origin of all beings. It reverses however the usual order, the earth being
              generally looked on as the female principle. We find no traces of it anterior to the
              Alexandrian period, when it is noticed by Lycophrôn<note place="bottom">Cassandra,
                1192. with the note of Tzetzes.</note> and Apollonius<note place="bottom">Argonaut,

            will commence with an account of her.</p>

            <head><hi rend="i">Νύξ. Nox. Night</hi>.</head>
            <p>In the Theogony Night is the daughter of Chaos, and sister of Erebos, to whom she
              bore Day and Æther<note place="bottom">Theog. 123.</note>. She is then said to have
              produced without a sire Fate (М<hi rend="i">όρος</hi>) and Kêr, Death, Sleep and
              Dreams, Momos (<hi rend="i">Mockery</hi>), Woe, the Hesperides, Nemesis, Deceit, Love
                (Φ<hi rend="i">ιλότης</hi>), Old-age, and Strife<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i"
                  >Ib.</hi> 211. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>It is not difficult to discern the reasons for giving this progeny to Night. It is a
              principle of all cosmogony that darkness preceded light, which sprang from it ; a
              truth here expressed by making Night the parent of Day and Æther. Night is also
              naturally regarded as the parent of Death, Sleep, Dreams, and their kindred ideas.
              Philotes, or the union of love, is also for a similar reason the child of Night<note
                place="bottom">Ἐν <hi rend="i">ϕι</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ότητι μιγϵȋσα</hi> and <hi

                and Hesiod.</note>. Deceit, Age, Strife, and Woe are figuratively her offspring ;
              the Hesperides are so because their abode was near hers in the West. Nemesis is
              probably a daughter of Night to indicate the secret concealed path which the divine
              justice often treads to inflict the punishment due to vice. The reason is not so
              apparent why Night should be the parent of Mockery.</p>
            <p>Hesiod places the abode of Night in the West, behind where Atlas supports the
                heavens<note place="bottom">Theog. 746. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. Night and
              Day, he says, are there by turns ; when one goes in the other goes out. Day <pb n="51"
                xml:id="p51"/>bears light to mortals ; Night, ‘wrapt in a sable cloud, carries Sleep
              in her arms.’ It is not quite clear whether the poet places the dwelling of Night on
              this side of or beyond Ocean<note place="bottom">See Völcker, Hom. Geog.
              p. 39.</note>.</p>
            <p>In Homer Sleep says to Hera that, when once at her desire he had cast Zeus into a
              slumber, the god on waking sought him, and would have flung him from the sky down into
              the sea, but that he took refuge with Night, ‘the subduer of gods and men,’ whom Zeus
              revering remitted his anger<note place="bottom">Il. xiv. 249. <hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi></note>. The poet gives here no intimation of any kindred between Night
              and Sleep. The dwelling of both would seem to be on Olympos.</p>
            <p>Alcman<note place="bottom">Fr. 123. Welcker.</note> and Sophocles<note place="bottom"
                >Fr. Incert. 93.</note> speak of the abode or <hi rend="i">springs</hi> of Night in
              the North, whilst Apollonius<note place="bottom">Argonaut. iv. 630.</note> appears to
              place them within the earth.</p>
            <p>It was, as we shall see, the custom of the poets (or perhaps such had been previously
              the popular creed) to bestow chariots and horses on those deities who had a long
              course to perform. We do not however find a vehicle assigned to Night by Homer or
              Hesiod ; but succeeding poets furnished her with one. Æschylus<note place="bottom"
                >Coëph. 656.</note> speaks of her ‘dark chariot’ ; Euripides<note place="bottom">Fr.
                Androm. 28.</note> describes her as driving through Olympos, — the sky according to
              the views of his time ; Theocritus<note place="bottom">Idyll. ii. 166.</note> calls
              the stars ‘the attendants on the car of quiet Night’ ; Apollonius<note place="bottom"
                >Argonaut. iii. 1193.</note> represents Night as yoking her horses at sunset ; and
                Statius<note place="bottom">Theb. ii. 59.</note> makes Sleep her charioteer.</p>
            <p>As the name of this deity is common to most of the languages which are akin to the
                Greek<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Nox</hi> Lat., <hi rend="i">Night</hi> Eng.,

            <p>Oceanos, the first-born of the Titans, espoused his sister Tethys. Their offspring

              came from the West. When Hercules was crossing his stream in the cup of the sungod to
              fetch the oxen of Geryôn, Oceanos rose, and by agitating his waters tried to terrify
              him, but on the hero's bending his bow at him he retired<note place="bottom"

            <p>Helios was the son of Hyperiôn by Theia, or according to a Homeridian hymn by
              Euryphaëssa (<hi rend="i">Wide-shining</hi>). His office was to give light to men and
              gods during the day.</p>
            <p>In the Odyssey, when Helios ends his diurnal career, he is said to go under the
                earth<note place="bottom">Od. x. 191. Compare Apoll. Rh. iii. 1191.</note> : it is
              not easy to determine whether the poet meant that he then passed through Tartaros back
              to the East during the night. At all events neither Homer nor Hesiod evinces any
              knowledge of the beautiful fiction of the solar cup or basin. The origin of this seems
              to lie in the simple fact that men, seeing the sun rise in the east and set in the
              west each day, were naturally led to inquire how his return to the east was effected.
              If then, as there is reason to suppose, it was the popular belief that a lofty
              mountainous ring ran round the edge of the earth, it was easy for the poets to feign
              that on reaching the western stream of Ocean Helios himself, his chariot and his

              Ovid also, the faithful follower of the Greeks, places the pastures of the solar
              steeds in the West, where they have ambrosia for grass<note place="bottom">Met. iv.

              where the Nereïdes and Seasons take off their harness. In Nonnus<note place="bottom"
                >Dionys. xii. l. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>, when the god arrives in the West,
              Phosphoros unyokes the sweating steeds, washes them in the waves of ocean, and then
              leads them to their stall ; and when they are rested the god drives them round the
              Ocean to the East. In two other passages of his wild poem<note place="bottom"><hi

              Sun in the East. It is remarkable that neither he nor the Latin poets ever allude to
              the cup. The park and gardens of Helios are thus richly described by Claudian<note

              the East that Ovid places the splendid palace of the Sun, where the lucid god sat
              enthroned, surrounded by the Days, Months, Years, Seasons, Ages, and Hours<note

            <p>From a consideration of all these passages it may seem to follow, that the ideas of
              the poets on this subject were very vague and fleeting. Perhaps the prevalent opinion
              was that the Sun rested himself and his weary steeds in the West, and then returned to
              the East. We are to recollect that the cup was <hi rend="i">winged</hi>, that is

              from whom he extracted an unwary oath that he would grant him whatever he asked. The
              ambitious youth instantly demanded permission to guide the solar chariot for one day,
              to prove himself there by the undoubted progeny of the Sun-god. Helios, aware of the
              consequences, remonstrated, but to no purpose. The youth persisted, and the god, bound
              by his oath, reluctantly committed the reins to his hands, warning him of the dangers
              of the road, and instructing him how to avoid them. Phaëthôn grasps the reins, the
              flame-breathing steeds spring forward, but soon aware that they are not directed by
              the well-known hand, they run out of the course ; the world is set on fire, and a
              total conflagration would have ensued, had not Zeus, at the prayer of Earth, launched
              his thunder, and hurled the terrified driver from his seat. He fell into the river

              been brought from the Baltic to Greece in the very earliest times. In the opinion of
                Welcker<note place="bottom">Tril. 566. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> it is only the
              Greek version of a German legend on that subject ; for the tradition of the people of
              the country was said to be<note place="bottom">Apoll. Rh. <hi rend="i">ut
                supra.</hi></note>, that the amber was produced from the tears of the Sun-god, that
              is Phœbos Apollo according to the Greeks, who added that he shed these tears when he
              came to the land of the Hyperboreans, an exile from heaven on account of the fate of
              his son Asclepios. But as this did not accord with the Hellenic conception of either
              Helios or Apollo, the Heliades were devised to remove the incongruity. The foundation
              of the fable lay in the circumstance of amber being regarded as a species of resin
              which drops from the trees that yield it. The tale of Cycnos is only one of the
              numerous legends devised by the Greeks to account for the origin of remarkable
              animals. The Eridanos is said to have been a mere poetic name, there being no stream
              actually so called ; though it was afterwards given by the poets to the Rhine, the
              Rhodanus or Rhone, and the Padus or Po, on the banks of which last stream the fable of
              Phaëthôn was localised.</p>
            <p>According to another legend Clytia, a daughter of Oceanos, was beloved by the
              Sun-god ; but he transferred his affections to Leucothea, daughter of Orchamos (<hi
                rend="i">Ruler</hi>), king of the eastern regions. The god visited her during the
              night, in the form of her mother. The virgin was obliged to comply with his wishes,
              and Clytia filled with jealous rage discovered the secret to Orchamos, who buried his
              hapless daughter alive. The god, unable to save her, turned her into the frankincense
              plant, and the neglected Clytia pining away became a sunflower<note place="bottom"

            <p>Here also we have one of the legendary origins of natural productions. The date of
              the tale is unknown, but it is probably not very ancient ; it is only to be found at

              Corinth, Argos, and some other places. The chief seat of his worship was the isle of
              Rhodes, where stood the celebrated Colossus, or statue of brass seventy cubits high,
              in his honour<note place="bottom">Pliny, H. N. xxxiv. 7.</note>. The legend said<note

              the other Immortals were dividing the earth among them by lot, the Sun happening to be
              absent got no share. On his reminding Zeus of this, the god was about to make a new
              allotment, but Helios would not suffer him, saying that he had seen a fertile land
              lying beneath the ‘hoary sea’, with which he would be content. The gods then swore
              that it should be the undisturbed possession of the Sun-god, and the isle of Rhodes
              emerged from the deep.</p>

            <p>Selene, the sister of Helios, drove her chariot through the sky while he was reposing
              after the toils of the day. There is, however, no allusion in Homer or Hesiod to the
              chariot of Selene. One of the Hymns<note place="bottom">Hom. Hymn xxxii. 7.</note>
              describes her as bathing in Ocean, putting on gleaming raiment, and ascending a
              chariot drawn by glittering steeds. Theocritus<note place="bottom">Idyll. ii.
                163.</note> also gives Selene horses ; but we do not meet any other mention of her
              chariot and horses in the Greek poets. In Ovid<note place="bottom">Rem. Amor. 258.
                Fasti, iv. 374.</note> her steeds are snow-white. Statius<note place="bottom">Theb.
                i. 336. See also viii. 271.</note> places her in a car drawn by two horses.
                Pausanias<note place="bottom">Paus. v. 11. 8.</note> says that one of the figures on
              the base of the throne of Zeus at Olympia was Selene driving a single horse, as it
              appeared to him ; but others said it was a mule, and they had a silly legend
              respecting it. The Latin Festus<note place="bottom">«Mulus vehiculo Lunæ adhibetur
                quod tam sterilis ea sit quam mulus, vel quod ut mulus non suo genere sed equi
                creetur, sic ea solis non suo, fulgore luceat.»</note> is the only writer who speaks
              of the car of the Moon being drawn by mules<note place="bottom">See Voss, Mythol.
                Briefe, ii. 7. 8. This able critic makes two most extraordinary mistakes on this
                subject. He says that Euripides gives Selene a chariot (Phœn. 178. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi>), whereas the poet in that place is evidently speaking of the chariot
                of Amphiaraos. Again, he says, «In Nonnus (vii. 244.) she drives in a silver car
                with unbridled mules.» It is the chariot of Semele, not of Selene, that is described
                by that poet.</note>.</p>

            <p>This Titan is in the Theogony<note place="bottom">Theog. 375.</note> said to be the
              sire of Astræos, Pallas and Perses, by Eurybia (<hi rend="i">Wide-force</hi>),
              probably the daughter of Pontos and Earth<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Ib.</hi>
                239.</note>. Astræos, as we have just seen, was by Eôs the father of the Winds.
              Pallas had by Styx the Ocean-nymph, Envy and Victory, Strength and Force ; and Perses
              married Asteria the daughter of Coios and Phœbe, by whom he had Hecate.</p>
            <p>There is some difficulty about these personages, who are hardly ever mentioned by the
              poets. The origin of the name Krios is not apparent<note place="bottom">Hermann
                renders it <hi rend="i">Sejugus</hi>, from κρί<hi rend="i">νω, to
                separate.</hi></note>. Pallas (<hi rend="i">Shaker</hi> ?) would seem from the names
              of his offspring to be of a moral, not of a physical nature, unlike the progeny of the
              three preceding Titans. With Astræos (<hi rend="i">Starry</hi>) and Perses (<hi
                rend="i">Bright</hi> ?), and their children, the difficulty is much less, for they
              are all physical beings.</p>
            <p>We cannot avoid here intimating our suspicion that the two moral beings Themis and
                Mnemosyne<note place="bottom">Hermann however makes them both natural beings,
                rendering Themis <hi rend="i">Statina</hi>, and Mnemosyne <hi rend="i">Moneta</hi>,
                or <hi rend="i">Mover.</hi></note> were not originally among the Titans. According
              to all analogy the sage or poet who devised the mythe of the six male and six female
              Titans must have intended to employ them in pairs in the task of production ; and yet
              we find Crios united with a daughter of Pontos and Earth, one of a class of beings
              quite alien from the Titans, and Iapetos with an Ocean-nymph ; while Themis and
              Mnemosyne are reserved to be the parents of moral beings by Zeus in the new order of
              things. This is surely not the order one might have anticipated. It is now, however,
              hardly possible to rectify the error, if it should be such.</p>

            <p>In the Theogony<note place="bottom">Theog. 409.</note> this goddess is the daughter
              of Perses and Asteria. Bacchylides made her a daughter of Night, and Musæus gave her
              Zeus for a sire in place of Perses<note place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. iii.
                467.</note>, while <pb n="66" xml:id="p66"/>others said that she was the offspring
              of the Olympian king by Pheræa, the daughter of Æolos<note place="bottom">Tzetz. Lyc.
                1180. Hecate was worshiped at Pheræ in Thessaly, hence this genealogy.</note>, or by
                Demeter<note place="bottom">Sch. Theocr. ii. 12.</note>. According to Pherecydes her
              sire was Aristæos<note place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. <hi rend="i">l.
              c.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>It is said in the Theogony<note place="bottom">Theog. 412. <hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi></note> that Hecate was highly honoured by Zeus, who allowed her to
              exercise extensive power over land and sea, and to share in all the honours enjoyed by
              the children of Heaven and Earth. She rewards sacrifice and prayer to her with
              prosperity. She presides over the deliberations of the popular assembly, over war, and
              the administration of justice. She gives success in wrestling and horseracing. The
              fisherman prays to her and Poseidôn ; the herdsman, to her and Hermes, — for she can
              increase and diminish at her will. Though an only child (in contrast to Apollo and
              Artemis, who have similar power) she is honoured with all power among the immortals,
              and is by the appointment of Zeus the rearer of children, whom she has brought to see
              the light of day.</p>
            <p>This passage is, however, plainly an interpolation in the Theogony, with which it is
              not in harmony. It has all the appearance of being an Orphic composition, and is
              perhaps the work of the notorious forger Onomacritus<note place="bottom">See Göttling
                  <hi rend="i">in loc.</hi> Thiersch, Ueber Hesiodos, p. 24.</note>.</p>
            <p>The name Hecate is the feminine of Hecatos, one of the epithets of Apollo<note
                place="bottom">Ἓκατοϛ, <hi rend="i">Far-shooter</hi> (from έκάϛ). Il. vii. 83 ; xx.
                295.</note>, and is itself an epithet of his sister Artemis<note place="bottom"
                  >Ἄρτєμι<hi rend="i">ν δ҆ έκάταν</hi>, Æschyl. Sup. 690.</note>. It was a common
              practice with the Greeks (of which we shall find many instances as we proceed) to form
              from the epithets of a deity other similar deities, or even hostile and rival beings,
              sometimes nymphs, or other companions of the original deity. In this manner, supposing
              Artemis to have been an original moon-goddess, her epithet of <hi rend="i"
                >Far-shooter</hi> (ἑκάτη) may have separated from her, and have become another
              moon-goddess, for such is the real character of Hecate ; or Hecate may have been the
              primitive name of the moon-goddess of one of the tribes of Greece.</p>
            <p>The system of <hi rend="i">Theocrasy</hi> which we have already mentioned <pb n="67"
                xml:id="p67"/>frequently confounded deities who were originally distinct, but it
              sometimes only re-united those which were really the same, but which had been
              separated in the progress of time. In Hecate we seem to have instances of both
              processes ; she was identified with Selene, Artemis, and Eileithyia, all probably
              moon-goddesses, and with Persephone, of whom the original conception was totally
              different.</p>
            <p>In consequence of this confusion Hecate became the patroness of magic and mistress of
              the under-world<note place="bottom">Apoll. Rh. iii. 862. Ovid, Met. <num>vii</num>.

              set up at Athens and elsewhere in the market-places and at cross-roads ; and at the

              which the poor would then come and eat, saying Hecate had eaten them<note

            <p>A name of this goddess was Brimo<note place="bottom">From βρέμω, to <hi rend="i"

              terrific appearance, especially when she came summoned by magic arts. Apollonius<note
                place="bottom">Argonaut. iii. 1214-1217.</note> describes her as having her head
              surrounded by serpents twining through branches of oak, while torches flamed in her
              hands, and the infernal dogs howled around her. Lucian’s ‘liar of the first
              magnitude,’ Eucrates<note place="bottom">Philopseud. 22-24.</note>, gives a most
              terrific description of her appearance. In this character she was also sometimes
              called Empusa<note place="bottom">Eudocia, 147.</note>. These were evidently all
              comparatively late ideas and fictions.</p>

            <p>We are now arrived at the immediate origin of the Olympians, the gods worshiped
              throughout all Greece.</p>
            <p>The mutilation of Uranos by his youngest son Kronos, and the overthrow of the latter
              by Zeus and his other children, the Kronids, have been already narrated. According to
              the Theogony<note place="bottom">Theog. 716. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> all the
              Titans (Oceanos, it would appear, excepted) were on this occasion shut up in Tartaros.
              Homer only names Kronos and Iapetos<note place="bottom">Il. viii. 479.</note>, but he
              evidently included the others in his view of the subject<note place="bottom">Il. xiv.
                274 ; xv. 225.</note>. At a later period it was said that Zeus had released the
                Titans<note place="bottom">Pind. Pyth. iv. 518.</note>. Hesiod in his didactic
                poem<note place="bottom">Works and Days, 167. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> says
              that Kronos ruled over the Isles of the Blest at the end of the earth by the
              ‘deep-eddying’ ocean ; and Pindar<note place="bottom">Ol. ii. 123. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi></note> gives a luxuriant description of this blissful abode, where the
              departed heroes of Greece dwelt beneath the mild rule of Kronos and his assessor
              Rhadamanthys. In the ‘Prometheus Loosed’ of Æschylus<note place="bottom">Æschyl. Fr.
                178. Welcker, Tril. 35. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> the chorus consisted of the
              twelve Titans, and they came as it would appear from the eastern part of the
              Ocean-stream.</p>
            <p>It was fabled at a late period that Kronos lay asleep, guarded by Briareôs, in a
              desert island near Britannia in the Western Ocean<note place="bottom">Plut. de Defect.
                Orac. 18. De Fac. in Orb. Lunæ, 26. Procopius Bell. Goth. iv. 20. «On the coast of
                the ocean opposite Britannia,» says Tzetzes (Lyc. 1204.), «dwell fishermen who are
                subjects of the Franks, but they pay them no tribute, on account, as they say, of
                their ferrying over the souls of the departed. They go to sleep in their houses in
                the evening, but after a little time they hear a knocking at the doors, and a voice
                calling them to their work. They get up and go to the shore, not knowing what the
                need is ; they see boats there, but not their own, with no one in them ; they get
                in, row away, and perceive that they are heavy as if laden with passengers, but they
                see no one. In one pull (ῥοπῇ) they reach the isle of Britannia, which with their
                own boats they can hardly reach in a day and a night. They still see no one, but
                they hear the voices of those that receive their passengers, and name their fathers
                and mothers, and themselves, and their ranks and occupations. They then return with
                their boats much lighter, and in one pull they reach their homes.» There is a
                curious legend somewhat similar to this in the Fairy Mythology (i. 202.), the scene

              Greeks to infer an identity of their ancient deity with the object of Phœnician
              worship. It was not improbably the circumstance of both gods being armed with a
              sickle, which led to the inference of Kronos being the same with the Saturnus of the

          <head type="sub">THE HOMERIC GODS IN GENERAL.</head>
          <p rend="noindent"><hi rend="sc">Familiarity</hi> is productive of indifference, and the
            greatest charms of nature and art lose most of their attractions in the eyes of those
            who are long and intimately acquainted with them. This is particularly the case with the
            beautiful mythology of Greece : we are in general familiar with its legends from an
            early age, but we view them detached and unconnected, ignorant of their place and
            importance in the system (though a loose one) to which they belong ; they therefore
            rarely produce their full effect on our minds. But did the Grecian mythology not enter
            into our literature, and were we to remain unacquainted with it till we should open the
            volumes of Homer, what a new world would burst on our sight, — how splendid would
            Olympos and its dwellers then arise to view ! To present the gods in their Olympian
            abode, and exhibit a sketch of their life and occupations, are the objects of the
            present chapter.</p>
          <p>As has been already stated, the Greeks of the early ages regarded the lofty Thessalian
            mountain named Olympos as the dwelling of their gods. In the Odyssey, where the deities
            are of a character far more dignified and elevated than in the Ilias, the place of their
            abode shares in their exaltation ; and it may almost be doubted if the poet who drew the
            following picture of Olympos could have conceived it to be no more than the summit of a
            terrestrial mountain.</p>

            invisible at their pleasure<note place="bottom">Il. i. 198.</note>. Their bodies are
            also of a finer nature than those of men. It is not blood, but a blood-like fluid named
              <hi rend="i">ichôr</hi>, which flows in their veins<note place="bottom">Il. v. 340.
              416.</note>. They are susceptible of injury by mortal weapons : the arrows of Hercules
            violate the divine bodies of Hera and Hades<note place="bottom">Il. v. 392. 395.</note>;
            Diomedes wounds both Aphrodite and Ares<note place="bottom">Il. v. 335. 855.</note>.
            They require nourishment as men do ; their food is called Ambrosia, their drink
              Nectar<note place="bottom">A passage in the Odyssey (xii. 63.) would seem to say that
              the ambrosia was brought each day by pigeons to Olympos from the shores of Ocean in
              the blissful West. See Appendix (F.).</note>. Their mode of life exactly resembles
            that of the princes and nobles of the heroic ages. In the palace of Zeus on Olympos they
            feast at the approach of evening, and converse of the affairs of heaven and earth ; the
            nectar is handed round by Hebe (<hi rend="i">Youth</hi>), Apollo delights them with the
            tones of his lyre, and the Muses in responsive strains <pb n="74" xml:id="p74"/>pour
            forth their melodious voices in song. When the sun descends, each god retires to repose
            in his own dwelling<note place="bottom">Il. i. 601. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. They
            frequently partake of the hospitality of men<note place="bottom">Il. i. 423. Od. i. 26.

          <p>With the form, the Homeric gods also partake of the passions of men. They are
            capricious, jealous, revengeful, will support their favourites through right and wrong,
            and are implacable toward their enemies, or even those who have slighted them<note
              place="bottom">Il. ix. 538.</note>. Their power was held to extend very far ; men
            regarded them as the authors of both good and evil ; all human ability and success was
            ascribed to them. They were believed to have power over the thoughts of men, and could
            imperceptibly suggest such as they pleased<note place="bottom">Il. i. 53 ; viii. 218 ;
              xvii. 468.</note>. They required of men to honour them with prayer, and the sacrifice
            of oxen, sheep, goats, lambs and kids, and oblations of wine and corn, and fragrant
              herbs<note place="bottom">Il. iv. 49 ; xxiv. 70.</note>. When offended, they usually
            remitted their wrath if thus appeased<note place="bottom">Il. ix. 497.</note>.</p>
          <p>The Homeric gods have all different ranks and offices ; Olympos being in fact regulated
            on the model of a Grecian city of the heroic ages. Zeus was king of the region of the
            air and clouds, which had fallen to him by lot on the dethronement of his father
            Kronos ; the sea was the realm of his brother Poseidôn ; the under-world fell to Aïdes,
            in the division of their conquests ; Earth and Olympos were common property<note
              place="bottom">Il. xv. 193.</note>. Zeus however, as eldest brother<note
              place="bottom">Il. xiii. 355 ; xv. 164.</note>, exercised a supremacy, and his power
            was the greatest. The other inhabitants of Olympos were Hera the sister and spouse of
            Zeus, Apollo the god of music and archery, his sister Artemis the goddess of the chace,
            and their mother Leto, Aphrodite goddess of love, and her mother Dione, Ares god of war,
            Pallas Athene goddess of prudence and skill, Themis goddess of justice, Hermeias god of
            gain, Hebe the attendant of the Olympian king and queen, and Iris their messenger,
            Hephæstos the celestial artist and Pæeôn the physician, and the Muses, the <pb n="75"
              xml:id="p75"/>Graces, and the Seasons. Poseidôn was frequently there ; but Demeter the
            goddess of agriculture, and Dionysos the god of wine, do not appear among the residents
            of Olympos. The Nymphs and the River-gods occasionally visited or were summoned to
              it<note place="bottom">Il. xx. 7.</note>. Eôs, Helios, and Selene rose every day out
            of the Ocean-stream, and drove in their chariots through the air, shedding their
            cheering beams abroad.</p>
          <p>Of the residents of Olympos, its king and his son Hephæstos<note place="bottom">Il.
              xviii. 382. Od. viii. 266. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> alone knew the pleasures or
            the pains of the wedded state. Ares and Hermeias intrigued occasionally with mortal
            women, but the character of Phœbos Apollo was of unstained purity<note place="bottom">We
              shall give in the sequel some reasons for regarding Il. ix. 559-64. as an
              interpolation.</note>. Of the goddesses, Aphrodite alone could be charged with breach
            of chastity<note place="bottom">Od. viii. <hi rend="i">ut supra.</hi> Il. v. 247.
              248.</note>; Artemis, Pallas Athene, Hebe, and Iris were all spotless virgins.</p>
          <p>All the dwellings of the gods upon Olympos were of brass (χάλκος), the metal which was
            in the greatest abundance in Greece. Hephæstos was architect and smith ; he formed all
            the arms, household furniture, chariots, and other articles in use among the
            Celestials ; but their dress, especially that of the goddesses, appears to have been the
            workmanship of Athena or the Graces<note place="bottom">Il. v. 735 ; xiv. 178.</note>.
            The gold which proceeded from the workshop of Hephæstos was filled with automatic
            power ; his statues were endowed with intelligence<note place="bottom">Il. xviii.
              417.</note> ; his tripods could move of themselves ; he made the golden shoes, or
            rather <hi rend="i">soles</hi> (πέιλα)<note place="bottom">We much doubt if the

              transported by them, be correct (See Heyne on Il. v. 768.) ; another notion of his,
              that the horses of the gods were shod by Hephæstos, is certainly erroneous, for the

              instances to be found of any other species of animal drawing the chariots of the gods

              drawn by sparrows ; and that of Alcæus to Apollo (below, ch. viii.), where the god has
              a team of swans.</note>, which could whirl them to and fro between heaven and earth
            through the yielding air, or skim with them along the surface of the sea without wetting
            the axle. They were only used on occasions of taking a long journey, as when Hera<note
              place="bottom">Il. xiv. 300.</note> professes that she is going to the end of the
            earth to make up the quarrel between Oceanos and Tethys ; or on occasions in which the

                rend="i">seq.</hi> ; xiii. 23. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> It is worthy of notice that
              while the chariots of men had sometimes three horses (Il. viii. 80-87 ; xvi.
              148-154.), or perhaps even four (viii. 185.), those of the gods had never more than
              two. Il. v. 768 ; viii. 41-45 ; xiii. 23. Od. xxiii. 245.</note>. On ordinary
            occasions the gods moved by the aid of their golden shoes : when at home in their
            houses, they, like the men of those ages, went barefoot.</p>
          <p>The Titans, as we have seen, were twelve in number, six of <pb n="77" xml:id="p77"
            />each sex. In like manner we find twelve Olympians, similarly divided. The gods were
            Zeus, Poseidôn, Hephæstos, Hermes, Apollo, Ares ; the goddesses were Hera, Demeter,
            Hestia, Athena, Aphrodite, and Artemis<note place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. ii.
              532.</note>. This arrangement could hardly have been known to Homer, who never
            mentions Hestia, and but incidentally Demeter. The earliest writer by whom we find the
            twelve gods noticed is Hellanicus, who says<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi>
              iii. 1085. Eudocia, 108.</note> that Deucaliôn built altars to them after the flood.
            It was perhaps the number of the months of the year that caused twelve to be fixed on as
            that of the Titans and the Olympians<note place="bottom">Welcker, Tril. 180. Böttiger,
              Kunst-Myth. ii. 52.</note> ; or it may have been because twelve was the political
            number of the Ionian race, for it seems probable that it was only among them,
            particularly at Athens<note place="bottom">Herod. ii. 7 ; vi. 108. Thuc. vi. 54. Plato,
              Laws. v. 745.</note>, that altars were erected to these twelve gods. At Olympia there
            were six altars to six pairs of deities, but they were not exactly the same with those
            above enumerated<note place="bottom">They were Zeus and Poseidôn, Hera and Athena,

            <pb n="79" xml:id="p79"/><p>In the Odyssey the character of this god is, agreeably to
              the more moral tone of that poem, of a higher and more dignified order. No indecent
              altercations occur ; both gods and men submit to his power without a murmur, yet he is
              anxious to show the equity of his decrees and to ‘justify his ways<note place="bottom"
                >Od. i. 32. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.’</p>
            <p>The Theogony, as we have seen, represents Zeus as the lastborn child of Kronos and
              Rhea, and according to it the supreme power was freely conferred on him by his
              brothers, and he thus became the acknowledged head of the Olympian gods, the objects
              of Grecian worship.</p>
            <p>Though Homer names the parents of nearly all the gods who appear in his poems, and it
              follows thence that they must have been born in some definite places, he never
              indicates any spot of earth as the natal place of any of his gods<note place="bottom"
                >The notion of Voss, that the gods were all born in the Island of the Blest at the

                Il. xiv. 201.</note>. A very ancient tradition, however, (for it occurs in Hesiod)
              made the isle of Crete the scene of the birth of the monarch of Olympos. According to
              this tradition Rhea, when about to be delivered of Zeus, retired to a cavern near
              Lyctos or Cnossos in Crete. She there brought forth her babe, whom the Melian nymphs
              received in their arms ; Adrasteia rocked him in a golden cradle, he was fed with
              honey and the milk of the goat Amaltheia, while the Curetes<note place="bottom">These
                beings, which have been confounded with the Corybantes and others, and made the
                subjects of much mystery, seem to be nothing but the Cretan young men (κοûροι), who
                used to dance the Pyrrhiche, or war-dance, thrown back to the mythic times, and
                associated with the deity in whose honour they performed their dance. See Lobeck,

              his cries from reaching the ears of Kronos<note place="bottom">Callimachus, Hymn to
                Zeus.</note>. According to another account the infant deity was fed on ambrosia
              brought by pigeons from the streams of Ocean, and on nectar which an eagle drew each
              day with his beak from a rock<note place="bottom"><quote><l> Τὸν μὲν ἂρα τρήρωνϵς ὑπὸ

              legend was gradually <pb n="80" xml:id="p80"/>pragmatised ; Zeus became a mortal king
              of Crete, and not merely the cave in which he was reared, but the tomb which contained
              his remains, was shown by the ‘lying Cretans<note place="bottom">Κ<hi rend="i">ρῆτες

                ver. 8.</note></p>
            <p>The Arcadians, on the other hand, asserted that Zeus first saw the light among their
              mountains. Rhea, they said, came to Mount Parrhasion, amidst whose thickets she
              brought forth her divine son. She sought for water to wash the new-born babe, but in
              vain, for Arcadia was then a land unwatered by streams ; the Ladôn, the Alpheios, and
              their kindred floods had not yet appeared. “Dear Earth ! do thou too bring forth,”
              said the goddess, and smiting the mountain with her staff she caused to gush from it a
              copious flow of water, which she named the Neda, from one of the nymphs who assisted
              at her labour, and who then conveyed the babe to Cnossos in Crete<note place="bottom"
                >Callim. <hi rend="i">ut supra.</hi></note>. The more general tradition, however,
              was that the nymph Neda and her sisters, Theisoa and Hagno, reared the infant deity in
              a cavern of Mount Lycæon, where there was a place named Cretes, as other spots in
              Arcadia were designated by names belonging to places in Crete<note place="bottom"
                >Paus. viii. 31. 4 ; 38. 3 ; 47. 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>All, therefore, that we can collect with safety from these accounts is that the
              worship of the Dictæan Zeus in Crete, and of the Lycæan Zeus in Arcadia, was of the
              most remote antiquity, and that thence, when the Euhemeristic principle began to creep
              in among the Greeks, each people supposed the deity to have been born among
              themselves. The Cretan legend must however be regarded as the more ancient, for the
              Arcadians evidently attempted to transfer the names of places in it to their own
              country, a practise of which as we proceed we shall meet with other instances.</p>
            <p>In the Theogony the celestial progeny of Zeus are enumerated in the following
                order<note place="bottom">Theog. 886. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Zeus first espoused Metis (<hi rend="i">Prudence</hi>), who exceeded gods and men in
              knowledge. But Heaven and Earth having told him that her first child, a maid, would
              equal himself in strength and counsel, and her second, a son, would be king of gods
              and men, he cajoled her when she was pregnant, and swallowed her ; and after a time
              the goddess Pallas Athene sprang <pb n="81" xml:id="p81"/>from his head. He then
              married Themis, who bore him the Seasons and Fates. The Oceanis Eurynome next produced
              him the Graces ; Demeter was then by him the mother of Persephone, Mnemosyne of the
              Muses, and Leto of Apollo and Artemis. His last spouse was Hera, who bore him Hebe,
              Ares, and Eileithyia.</p>
            <p>According to Homer<note place="bottom">Il. v. 370, 371.</note> Aphrodite was the
              daughter of Zeus by Dione. The Theogony further says that Maia, the daughter of Atlas,
              bore him Hermes<note place="bottom">Theog. 938</note> A later fable said that Asteria,
              the sister of Leto, flying the love of Zeus, flung herself from heaven down to the sea
              and became the isle afterwards named Delos<note place="bottom">It is curious to mark
                the apparent progress of this tale. In the text we have followed Callimachus (Hymn
                iv. 37. <hi rend="i">seq.)</hi>, who says, alluding to her name, that she came down
                ‘like a star.’ This was probably the more ancient version, but it was also said that
                she took the form of a quail, <hi rend="i">ὄρτυξ</hi>, (see Apollod. i. 4. l.
                Hygin. 53. Serv. on Æn. <num>iii</num>. 73.), whence the isle was named Ortygia.
                This identification of Delos and Ortygia was, however, certainly later than the time
                of Pindar, who (Nem. i. 4.) calls them sisters. (See below, chap. viii.) The whole
                legend seems to owe its origin to the affinity of sense between the words Asteria
                and Delos.</note>.</p>
            <p>Mortal women also bore a numerous progeny to this amorous monarch of the gods, and
              every species of transmutation and disguise was employed by him to accomplish his
              object. He assumed the form of her husband Amphitryôn to deceive the modesty of
              Alcmena, who became the mother of Heracles. Leda was beguiled by him in the shape of a
              beautiful white swan. Under the form of a shower of gold he penetrated the brazen
              prison in which Danae was inclosed, and became the father of Perseus. Antiope, the
              mother of Amphiôn and Zethos, was forced by him in the guise of a satyr. To seduce the
              Arcadian nymph Callisto he presumed to take the form of Artemis, the goddess of
              chastity. A bull was the form in which he carried off Europa, the sister of Cadmos ;
              and a flame of fire or the plumage of an eagle disguised the god from Ægina, the
              mother of Æacos. By Semele he was the father of Dionysos, who became a god. By Io he
              had a son named Epaphos. Many other heroes could also boast of being the sons of Zeus
              by different mothers. Of all these mortal loves <pb n="82" xml:id="p82"/>we shall give
              a detailed account when we come to speak of the heroes who sprang from them.</p>
            <p>The love of Zeus (and in this there lies a moral) was not always a source of
              happiness to those whom he honoured with it. Io, for example, underwent a dreadful
              persecution from Hera, as also did Leto. Semele perished in the flames which invested
              the lord of the thunder and lightning. Danae and her babe were abandoned to the waves
              of the sea.</p>
            <p>We shall presently show that the name Zeus signifies God. When, therefore, we
              recollect how usual it was in the oriental and early Greek style to represent
              magnitude or excellence by associating it with the name of the deity<note

              epithet was probably the germ of the mythe ; Zeus was then placed at the head of a
              genealogy ; and last came the poets, who detailed the amorous history.</p>
            <p>It seems to have been an ancient opinion that the gods used to assume the human form
              and go among mankind to mark their conduct<note place="bottom">Od. xvii. 484. <hi

              notion — which carries our minds back to those happy ages commemorated in the Book of
              Genesis, ‘when angels dwelt and God himself with man’ — we are indebted for some
              interesting legends told by poets, of Zeus taking the human form, and coming down to
              view more closely the conduct of mankind over whom he ruled. Such was his visit to
              Lycaôn king of Arcadia, whom he punished for his impiety ; and that on occasion of
              which the piety of Hyrieus was rewarded by the birth of Oriôn. The most pleasing tale
              is that of Philemôn and Baucis, narrated by Ovid in his most agreeable manner, to the
              following effect<note place="bottom">Met. <num>viii</num>. 620. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>
                We have been unable to discover his Greek original.</note>.</p>
            <p>Zeus and Hermes came one time in the form of men to a town in Phrygia. It was
              evening ; they sought for hospitality, but every door was closed against them. At
              length they approached a humble cottage where dwelt an aged man, named Philemôn, with
              Baucis his wife, of equal years : by them the wayfarers were gladly received. The poet
              pleases his imagination amidst the luxury of Rome in describing the furniture of their
              simple abode, and the homely fare, though their best, which they set before their
              celestial guests, whose quality was at length revealed by the miracle of the wine-bowl
              being spontaneously replenished as fast as it was drained. They told their hosts that
              it was their intention to destroy the godless town, and desired them to leave their
              house and ascend the adjacent hill. The aged pair obeyed : ere they reached the summit
              they turned round to look, and beheld a lake where the town had stood. Their own house
              remained, and, as they gazed and deplored the fate of their neighbours it became a
              temple. On being desired by Zeus to express their wishes, they prayed that they might
              be appointed to officiate in that temple, and that they might be united in death as in
              life. Their prayer was granted, and as they were one day standing before the temple,
              they were suddenly changed into an oak and a lime-tree<note place="bottom">The reader
                will doubtless have observed the resemblance between this legend and the account of
                Lot and the angels in the book of Genesis, which last may have been carried to
                Greece, or have been learned by the Greeks at Alexandria. See Leclerc’s ‘Dissertatio
                de Sodoma, &amp;c.’ in his ‘Mosis Prophetæ V Libri, &amp;c.’ In the Fairy Mythology

            <p>It was the habit of the Greeks to appropriate particular plants and animals to the
              service of their deities. There was generally some reason for this, founded on
              physical or moral grounds, or on both. Nothing could be more natural than to assign

              the Olympian games were celebrated in his honour : he had also a splendid fane in the

              statues, all the inhabitants of Hellas conspired in the duty of doing homage to the
              sovereign of the gods. His great oracle was at Dodona, where, even in the Pelasgian

            <p>A very simple process will lead us to the true signification of the name of this
              deity. Its Æolic form is <hi rend="i">Δεὑς</hi>, which is almost the same as the <hi

                >God</hi>, the same as <hi rend="i">θεòς, deus</hi>, and akin to the Persian <hi

              Poseidôn that unyokes his horses<note place="bottom">Il. viii. 440.</note>; the same
              god is said to have given the Harpy-born steeds of Achilles to Peleus<note
                place="bottom">Il. xxiii. 277.</note> ; he is joined with Zeus as the teacher of the
              art of driving the chariot<note place="bottom">Il. xxiii. 307.</note>; and when

              clear himself by an oath to Poseidôn<note place="bottom">Il. xxiii. 584.</note>.</p>
            <p>All this indicates a close connexion between the sea-god and the horse. The usual
              solution given is, that as, according to Herodotus, the worship of Poseidôn came from
              Libya to Greece, and (the Libyans being an agricultural, not a <pb n="87" xml:id="p87"
              />seafaring people) the agents must have been the Phœnicians, who also, we are
              assured, brought the first horses into Greece (as the Spaniards did into America, and
              as much to the astonishment of the rude natives), the knowledge of the horse and of
              Poseidôn thus came together, and they were therefore associated in the popular
                mind<note place="bottom">See Böttiger, Kunst-Myth. ii. 325. <hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>This, we may observe, is all merely gratuitous hypothesis. The absurd passion of
              Herodotus for deducing the religion of Greece from abroad is so notorious, that few,
              we should suppose, would lay any stress on his testimony in these matters. Had a god
              of the sea been worshiped in Egypt, beyond question the historian would have derived
              Poseidôn from that country. Again, what can be more absurd than to suppose that
              Greece, a portion of the continent of Europe, to the north of which dwelt the
              Thracians and Scythians, renowned in all ages for their horses<note place="bottom">See
                Il. xiii. 4. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>, should have first received these animals
              from the coast of Africa ? We may therefore, we think, safely dismiss this hypothesis,
              and look for an explanation of the phænomenon elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The horse is the principal means of transport by land, as the ship is by sea ; the
              one name might therefore be metaphorically employed for the other. Thus in Homer<note

                ship of the desert.</hi> This seems to offer a natural solution of the difficulty,
              the sea-god being regarded as the author of ships, the horses of the sea, and thence

              regarding the horse as in some mysterious manner connected <pb n="88" xml:id="p88"

            <p>It is rather curious to observe the manner in which Poseidôn and Pallas Athene are
              associated. They were worshiped together, — he as Hippios, she as Hippia, — at Colonos
              near Athens<note place="bottom">Paus. i. 30. 4.</note> ; we find them united in the

              to yield, in the latter Zeus decided that they should hold the dominion in common. In

            <p>Hades, the brother of Zeus and Poseidôn, was lord of the subterrane region, the abode

                correct ideas on this subject.</note> ; the poets everywhere describe it as dreary,
              dark, and cheerless. The dead, without distinction of good or evil, age or rank,
              wander about there, conversing of their former state on earth : they are unhappy, and
              they feel their wretched state acutely. Achilles, the son of a goddess, declares to
              Odysseus that he would rather be a day-labourer to the poorest cultivator on earth
              than a king in those regions. They have no strength or power of mind <pb n="91"

                (Od. xi. 568-630.) in which these personages are mentioned was doubted by
                Aristarchus. Notwithstanding the arguments of Payne Knight (Proleg. § xix.) in
                defence of it, we incline to the opinion of the Alexandrian critic.</note>. Nothing
              can be more gloomy and comfortless than the whole aspect of the realm of Hades as
              pictured in the Odyssey. It is in fact surprising, that men who had such a dreary
              prospect before them should not have been more attached to life, and more averse from
              war and everything that might abridge its period, than the ancient Greeks were<note

            <p>In process of time, when communication with Egypt and Asia had enlarged the sphere of
              the ideas of the Greeks, the nether-world underwent a total change. It was now divided

              thought to lie far beneath it, and to be the prison of the Titans, became one of these
              regions, and the place of punishment for wicked men ; and Elysion, which lay on the
              shore of the stream of Ocean, the retreat of the children and relatives of the king of
              the gods, was moved down thither to form the place of reward for good men. A stream
              encompassed the domains of Hades<note place="bottom">The <hi rend="i">river</hi> which

            <p>In reading the ‘portentous lies’ (as they have well been termed<note place="bottom"
                >Lobcck, Aglaoph. 811.</note> ) of the Egyptian priests on this subject, one is at a
              loss which most to admire at, <hi rend="i">their</hi> audacity, or the credulity of
              the Greeks. For the former asserted, and the latter believed, that Orpheus and Homer
              had both learned wisdom on the banks of the Nile ; and that the Erebos of Greece, and
              all its parts, personages and usages, were but transcripts of the mode of burial in
              Egypt. Here the corpse was, on payment of an obelos, conveyed by a ferryman (named
              Charôn in the language of Egypt) over the Acherusian lake, after it had received its
              sentence from the judges appointed for that purpose. Oceanos was but the Egyptian name
              of the Nile ; the Gates of the Sun were merely those of Heliopolis ; and Hermes, the
              conductor of souls<note place="bottom">See Od. xxiv. 1-14.</note>, was familiar to the
                <pb n="93" xml:id="p93"/>Egyptians ; and thus they appropriated all the mythic ideas
              of Greece. It may give some idea of their hardihood, to observe that they affirmed, on
              the authority of their sacred books and temple-archives, that Orpheus, Musæos,
              Melampûs and Dædalos — not one of whom probably ever existed — had all visited
                Egypt<note place="bottom">Diodor. i. 92, 96.</note>. But enough of such mendacity :
              we should not have noticed it, were it not that the fashion of tracing the religion
              and institutions of Greece to Egypt is not yet extinct.</p>
            <p>Before we quit Aïdoneus and his realms, we must call attention to the circumstance of
              mankind agreeing to place the abode of departed souls either beneath the earth, or in
              the remote regions of the West. The former notion, it is probable, owes its origin to
              the simple circumstance of the mortal remains of man being deposited by most nations
              in the bosom of the earth ; and the habits of thinking and speaking which thence
              arose, led to the notion of the soul also being placed in a region within the earth.
              The calmness and stillness of evening succeeding the toils of the day, the majesty of
              the sun sinking as it were to rest amid the glories of the western sky, exert a
              powerful influence over the human mind, and lead us almost insensibly to picture the
              West as a region of bliss and tranquillity. The idea of its being the abode of the
              departed good, where in calm islands they dwelt ‘from every ill remote,’ was therefore
              an obvious one<note place="bottom">The North American Indians place the happy
                hunting-grounds of the departed far away beyond a stream in the West. The ideas of
                the Greenlanders, and of some of the tribes of South America, are similar. See
                Völcker, H. G. 142.</note>. Finally, the analogy of the conclusion of the day and
              the setting of the sun with the close of life, may have led the Greeks<note
                place="bottom">This notion scems almost peculiar to the Odyssey ; the only allusion
                to it that we have met with elsewhere is in Sophocles (Œd. Tyr. 176.), where Hades
                is called ‘the western god’ (<hi rend="i">ἀκτὰν πρὸς ἑσπέρου θεοῦ</hi>).</note>, or
              it may be the Phœnicians, to place the dwelling of the dead in general in the dark
              land on the western shore of Ocean.</p>
            <p>Hades, we are told by Homer, possessed a helmet which rendered its wearer invisible :
              it was forged for him by Hephæstos, the later writers say, in the time of the war
              against the Titans. Pallas Athene, when aiding Diomedes, wore it <pb n="94"
                xml:id="p94"/>to conceal her from Ares<note place="bottom">II. v. 845.</note>. When
              Perseus went on his expedition against the Gorgons, the helm of invisibility covered
              his brows<note place="bottom">Apollod. i. 6, 2.</note>. This helmet of Hades will find
              its parallel in tales both of the East and the West, now consigned to the nursery.</p>
            <p>By artists, the god of the nether-world was represented similar to his brothers, but
              he was distinguished from them by his gloomy and rigid mien. He usually bears a

              very remarkable notion of the Greeks. The dead seem to have been regarded in the light
              of victims offered to Hades<note place="bottom">“Victima nil miserantis Orci.” — <hi

              and Zeus then resuming his proper form accomplished his wishes. But when she had

              raised a storm, which drove his son Heracles out of his course at sea, he tied her
              hands together and suspended her with anvils at her feet between heaven and earth<note

            <p>In the mythic cycles of Dionysos and Heracles Hera acts a prominent part as the
              persecutor of the heroes of them, who were the offspring of Zeus by mortal mothers. In
              like manner, as the goddess of Argos, she is active in the cause of the Achæans in the
              war of ‘Troy divine’. In the Argonautic cycle she was the protecting deity of the
              adventurous Iasôn. There is, in fact, none of the Olympian deities more decidedly
              Grecian in feeling and character than this goddess.</p>
            <p>The chief seats of the worship of Hera were Argos, Samos, and Platæa. She was also
              honoured at Sparta, Corinth, Corcyra, and other places. The victims offered to her
              were kine, ewe-lambs and sows. The willow, the pomegranate, the dittany, the lily,
              were her sacred plants. Among birds, the cuckoo, and afterwards the gaudy stately
              peacock, were appropriated to the Olympian queen.</p>
            <p>According to the legend the goddess herself formed this last bird from the many-eyed
              Argos, whom she had set as keeper over the transformed Io. Moschus<note place="bottom"

              this bird.</p>
            <p>The peacock (<hi rend="i">ταὼς</hi>), we must observe, was unknown in the days of
              Homer, when, as we have already shown, the gods had not as yet any favourite animals.
              It is an Indian bird, and was according to Theophrastus introduced into Greece from

            <p>This is, we think justly, regarded as a sportive adaptation by the epic poet of an
              ancient physical mythe of the union of Zeus and Hera (heaven and earth, as we shall
              presently show) <pb n="99" xml:id="p99"/>in spring-time producing vegetation. It is in
              effect the <hi rend="i">Sacred Marriage</hi> (<hi rend="i">ἱϵρὸς γάμος</hi>) of these
              deities, which, as we will now proceed to explain, was represented in those places
              where Hera was principally worshiped.</p>
            <p>We have above related the Argive legend in which the cuckoo, the herald of the
              spring, appears as the agent in the loves of the two deities. There was a fount at
              Nauplia near Argos named Canachos, by bathing in which Hera, the legend said, renewed
              each year her virginity<note place="bottom">Paus. ii. 38. 2.</note>. In the temple of
              this goddess near Mycenæ (in which stood her statue, the far-famed labour of
              Polycleitos) was shown her bed<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> ii. 17.
                3.</note> ; a stream called Asteriôn ran by the temple, and on its banks grew the
              plant of the same name, which was used for weaving the (bridal ?) coronals of the
                goddess<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> ii. 17. 2.</note>. The garland of
              Hera was termed <hi rend="i">πυ</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ϵὼν</hi> by the Spartans, and was
              formed of the plant named Kyperos, and of the Helichrysos, which is of the same <hi
                rend="i">genus</hi> with the Asteriôn<note place="bottom">Alcman Fr. 29.</note>. At
              Argos there was a temple of Hera, Antheia (<hi rend="i">Flowery</hi>)<note
                place="bottom">Paus. ii. 22. 1.</note>. In all these usages and circumstances the
              idea of the marriage of Hera, and its being the cause of the spring of plants, may, we
              think, be discerned.</p>
            <p>The tradition of Stymphalos in Arcadia was<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi>
                viii. 22. 2.</note>, that Hera had been brought up there by Temenos, who raised
              three temples to her, under the names of Virgin, Married (<hi rend="i">τϵ</hi>λ<hi
                rend="i">ϵία</hi>), and Widow ; the first while she was a maid, the second when she
              married Zeus, the third when she separated from him. The real cause of these names
              will however appear from a comparison of this legend with the one just given, and with
              those which are to follow.</p>
            <p>At Samos the temple of Hera stood on the banks of the Imbrasos, and within its
              precincts was shown a willow (<hi rend="i">λύγος</hi>), beneath whose shade, according
              to the temple-legend, the goddess was born<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi>
                vii. 4. 4.</note>. Another name of the Imbrasos was said to be Parthenios<note

              image (<hi rend="i">βρέτας</hi>) of Hera disappeared from the temple ; it was then
              diligently sought for, and was always found on the sea-shore <pb n="100" xml:id="p100"
              />bound to a willow, whose longest branches were drawn down so as to envelope it. The
              priestess then loosed it ; it was washed ; a kind of cakes were set before it, and it
              was brought back to the temple<note place="bottom">Menodotos <hi rend="i">ap.</hi>
                Athen. xv. p. 672.</note>. In this ceremony also may be discerned a reference to the
              marriage of Hera. The disappearance of the image looks like the carrying away of the
              betrothed maiden ; the willow bed, for such it apparently is, refers perhaps to the
              chastity of the goddess, the willow being regarded as a great promoter of this
                virtue<note place="bottom">Plin. H. N. xxiv. 9.</note>; she is bound to it probably
              to prevent her flight from Zeus. The cakes may have had some analogy with the <hi
                rend="i">confarreatio</hi> of the Romans<note place="bottom">“Novæque nuptæ farreum
                præferebant.” — Plin. H. N. xviii. 3.</note>, or our own usage of bride-cakes. In
              the temple there was a statue of the goddess in the bridal-dress<note place="bottom"
                >“Nubentis habitu.” — Varro.</note>, and a new bridal-robe was woven for it every
                year<note place="bottom">In Elis it was woven every fifth year. Paus. v. 16.
                2.</note>.</p>
            <p>Like most of the usages and ceremonies of Greece, this Samian custom was
                pragmatised<note place="bottom">Athen. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi></note>. The temple,
              it was said, had been built by the Lelegians and the Nymphs ; Admeta, daughter of
              Eurystheus, fled thither from Argos ; the goddess appeared in a vision to her, and she
              became priestess of the temple. Some Tyrrhenian pirates, at the instigation of the
              Argives, stole the image, in order to draw down the vengeance of the people on Admeta.
              But lo ! their ship became motionless when the sacred image was brought on board.
              Interror the pirates carried it back to the shore, and made an offering of cakes to
              appease it. They then departed, and next day the rude ignorant people of the isle, in
              their search after it, finding it on the sea-shore, thought it had run away of itself,
              and bound it to a willow to prevent its doing so again. Admeta then loosed it and
              restored it to its place in the temple, and hence it was said arose the annual
              ceremony.</p>
            <p>In the name Admeta, it will be observed, we have here again a reference to the
              chastity of the goddess. The making her an Argive, and daughter of Eurystheus, appears
              also to intimate that the worship of Hera came to Samos from Argos, and that it
              belonged to the ante-Dorian period.</p>
            <pb n="101" xml:id="p101"/><p>In Bœotia the popular mythe had taken a somewhat different
              view of the character of Hera, and she appears as the jealous wife, such as she is
              represented in the Ilias.</p>
            <p>Hera, the legend said, offended for some cause or another with Zeus, renounced his
              bed and society. The god in perplexity sought advice from the autochthon Alalcomenos,
              and by his counsel gave out that he was going to marry another ; and cutting down a
              handsome tree, they shaped it into the form of a woman, naming it Dædala, and arrayed
              it in the bridal habit. The bridal hymn was sung, the nymphs of the Tritôn furnished
              the bath, Bœotia gave pipes and dances, and the pretended bride was placed on a car
              drawn by kine. When this reached the ears of Hera she could not contain herself, but
              coming down in a rage from Cithærôn, followed by the women of Platæa, she rushed to
              the car, seized the supposed bride, and tore off her dress. Then discovering the
              cheat, she became reconciled to her lord, and with joy and laughter took herself the
              place of the bride, and committed the image to the flames<note place="bottom">Plut.
                Fr. ix. 6. Paus. ix. 3. 41.</note>.</p>
            <p>This legend was invented to explain the origin of a national festival of Bœotia named
              the Dædala. Of this there were two kinds, the Small, celebrated every seven, the
              Great, every sixty years. According to Pausanias, there was a wood near Alalcomenæ
              where grew the finest oaks in Bœotia, to which the Platæans repaired, and setting some
              dressed meat before it, and watching the ravens, marked which of them took the meat,
              and on what tree he sat. They then cut down that tree, and made an image from it. It
              is probable that the other cities of Bœotia did the same ; and this was called the
              Little Dædala. When the time of the Great Dædala came, there were fourteen images
              ready (one for each of the cities of Bœotia), with which they repaired to the banks of
              the Asopos. Each image was placed on a car, and a bridemaid (<hi rend="i"
                >νυμϕϵύτρια</hi>) set beside it. The procession then moved on, each car taking its
              place by lot, and ascended to the summit of Cithærôn, where an altar of wood stood
              ready prepared ; a bull was there sacrificed to Zeus, and a cow to Hera ; wine and
              perfumes, and other victims, were cast on the altar, <pb n="102" xml:id="p102"/>as
              also were the images, and the whole was set on fire, and a flame thus raised which was
              visible to a great distance<note place="bottom">Paus. <hi rend="i">ut
                supra.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>From the very confused account of this festival which has been transmitted to us, it
              is a matter of much difficulty to ascertain its real character. It seems most
              probable, however, that it was designed to form an astronomical cycle, and to serve as
              a calendar of time, and also to operate as a bond of union among the Bœotian states.
              For our present purpose it is sufficient to remark the union expressed in it of Zeus
              and Hera, and the sacrifice of the bull and cow to these deities.</p>
            <p>There was another legend of Zeus and Hera, of which Cithærôn was also the scene. The
              maiden Hera, it said, was reared in Eubœa ; but Zeus stole her away, and Cithærôn gave
              him a shady cavern to conceal her in. When her nurse Macris came in quest of her
              charge and wanted to search the cavern, Cithærôn would not permit her, saying that
              Zeus was abiding there with Leto. The nurse then went away, and Hera in consequence of
              this associated Leto with herself in her temple and altar under the title <hi rend="i"
                >Of-the-Recess</hi>(Μ<hi rend="i">υχία</hi>)<note place="bottom">Plut. Fr. ix.
                3.</note>.</p>
            <p>Here again we meet the Sacred Marriage performed in secret, as at Argos. In Eubœa
              Hera was called <hi rend="i">Virgin</hi> (Π<hi rend="i">άρθϵνος</hi>)<note
                place="bottom">Eustath. II. ii. p. 286.</note> ; and a place there sacred to her was
              named Parthenion. Macris (which we find personified in the legend) was a name of that
              island.</p>
            <p>The marriage of Zeus and Hera was viewed as the pattern of those of mankind, and the
              goddess was held to preside over the nuptial league. Hence she was named the <hi
                rend="i">Yoker</hi> (Ζ<hi rend="i">υγία</hi>), the <hi rend="i">Consecrator</hi>
                (Τ<hi rend="i">ϵ</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ϵία</hi>), the <hi rend="i">Marriage-goddess</hi>
                (Г<hi rend="i">αμή</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ιος</hi>).</p>
            <p>As we have already hinted, we are inclined to assent to the opinion of those who view
              in Zeus the heaven, and in Hera the earth, and regard this holy marriage so
              continually renewed, and of which the memory was kept up in so many places, as that of
              heaven and earth in the spring of each returning year, when the showers descend, and
              foliage, herbage, and flowers cover the face of nature<note place="bottom">See Welcker

              the mythe of the perpetually renewed virginity of the goddess. The physical union of
              earth and heaven is, we think, plainly discernible in the beautiful passage of Homer

            <p>The consecration of the cow to Hera is also to be considered as a proof of her being
              regarded as the earth ; for in the religion of the ancient Germans (which was akin to
              that of the Greeks) the cow was assigned to the service of the goddess Hertha, or
              Earth. At Argos the chariot in which the priestess of Hera rode was drawn by oxen<note

              too were the cars in the procession of the Dædala, where a cow also was the victim. It
              has likewise been supposed, not without reason, that the ancient epithet of the
              goddess, <hi rend="i">Ox-eyed</hi> or <hi rend="i">Cow-eyed</hi> (β<hi rend="i">οῶπις</hi>), refers to this connection between her and that animal<note

            <p>Hera was represented by Polycleitos seated on a throne, holding in one hand a

            <p>The origin of the name Hera is somewhat difficult to determine. We may venture to
              reject the derivations from <hi rend="i">ἀὴρ, air</hi>, and from <hi rend="i">ἐράω, to

              nuptial union. As the goddess of the earth in the religion of Argos, her name would
              seem to come very simply from <hi rend="i">ἔρα, earth</hi> ; yet there is great

            <p>The figurative language, which expresses origin and resemblance by terms of
              paternity, gave a mortal progeny to Ares. As a person who came by sea was figuratively
              called a son of Poseidôn, so a valiant warrior was termed <hi rend="i">a son</hi>, or,
              as it is sometimes expressed by Homer, <hi rend="i">a branch</hi> or <hi rend="i"
                >shoot of Ares</hi> (<hi rend="i">ὄζος</hi> Ἄ<hi rend="i">ρηος</hi>). But the only
              tale of his amours related at any length by the poets is that of his intrigue with
              Aphrodite.</p>
            <p>Ares — so sang Demodocos to the Phæacians<note place="bottom">Od. viii. 266. <hi
                  rend="i">seq.</hi> Ovid, A. A. ii. 561.</note> — loved Aphrodite, and often
              visited her in the absence of her unsightly husband. These visits were not unobserved
              by Helios (for what can escape the piercing eye of the Sun-god ?), and he gave
              information to the injured artist. Hephæstos dissembled his rage, and going to his
              workshop forged a net so subtile as to be invisible, so strong as to be infrangible by
              even the god of war. He disposed it in such a manner as to catch the lovers : then
              feigning a journey, set out as it were for Lemnos. Ares, who was on the watch, flew to
              his expecting mistress : the heedless lovers were caught in the net : the Sun-god gave
              notice ; the husband returned, and standing at his door called all the gods to come
              and behold the captives. The dwellers of Olympos laughed heartily, and some jokes were
              passed on the occasion. Poseidôn however took no part in the mirth, but drawing
              Hephæstos aside pressed him to accommodate the affair. The artist, doubtful of the
              honour of the soldier, was loath to assent, till Poseidôn pledged himself to see him
              paid. He then yielded, and released his prisoners. Ares hastened away to his favourite
              region of Thrace : Aphrodite fled to hide her shame in her beloved isle of Cyprus.</p>
            <p>This tale is an evident interpolation in the part of the <pb n="106" xml:id="p106"
              />Odyssey where it occurs. Its date is uncertain ; but the language, the ideas, and
              the state of society which it supposes, might almost lead us to assign its origin to a
              comparatively late period. It may be, as is generally supposed, an ancient physical
              mythe, or rather a combination of two such mythes ; for beauty might naturally have
              been made the spouse of the god from whose workshop proceeded so many elegant
              productions of art, and, as we are about to show, another physical view led to the
              union of Ares and Aphrodite. Still we cannot avoid regarding the present tale rather
              as a sportive effusion of Grecian wit and satire. In Greece, as everywhere else,
              wealth and beauty were occasionally united in wedlock ; and there too, as elsewhere,
              martial renown and showy exterior were passports to the hearts of the fair. If the
              tale was framed on the coast of Asia, we know that warfare was frequent enough among
              the Grecian cities there to allow of reputation being gained by deeds of valour<note
                place="bottom">See Herod. vi. 42.</note>.</p>
            <p>To the above tale has also been appended by later writers a legendary origin of the
              cock (<hi rend="i">ἀ</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ϵκτρυών</hi>). It is said that Alectryôn was a
              youth whom Ares placed to watch while he was with Aphrodite ; and, for neglect of his
              task, he was changed by the angry god into the bird of his name<note place="bottom"

              appearance of a physical mythe, for from Love and Strife (i. e. attraction and
              repulsion) it is clear, arises the order or <hi rend="i">harmony</hi> of the

              of whose union with Hephæstos (to whom he gives a different spouse) he seems to have
              known nothing. In the Ilias we may observe that Ares and Aphrodite are spoken of as
              brother and sister, much in the same manner as Apollo and Artemis<note place="bottom"

            <p>The Hill of Ares (Ἄ<hi rend="i">ρϵιος πάγος</hi>), at Athens, is said to have derived
              its appellation from the following circumstance. Halirrhothios, a son of Poseidôn, had
              offered violence to Alcippe, the daughter of Ares. Her father killed the offender, and
              he was summoned by Poseidôn before a court of justice for the murder. The trial was
              held on this hill, the twelve gods sat as judges, and Ares was acquitted<note
                place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 14. Sch. Eur. Orest. 1665.</note>. Another tradition
              derived the name of the hill from the Amazons having there offered sacrifices to Ares,
              their sire<note place="bottom">Æschyl. Sup. 683-8.</note>. It is quite manifest
              therefore that the real origin of the name was unknown.</p>
            <p>The temples and images of Ares were not numerous. He is represented as a warrior, of
              a severe menacing air, dressed in the heroic style, with a cuirass on, and a round
              Argive shield on his arm. His arms are sometimes borne by his attendants.</p>
            <p>The epithets of Ares were all significative of war. He was styled by Homer and

              having been one of the telluric powers in the Pelasgian creed, and to think that, like

            <p>Hephæstos, the Olympian artist, is in Homer the son of Zeus and Hera<note
                place="bottom">II. i. 572, 578.</note>. According to Hesiod<note place="bottom"
                >Théog. 927.</note> he was the son of <pb n="108" xml:id="p108"/>Hera alone, who was
              unwilling to be outdone by Zeus when he had given birth to Pallas-Athene. He was born
              lame, and his mother was so displeased at the sight of him that she flung him from
              Olympos. The Ocean-nymph Eurynome and the Nereïs Thetis saved and concealed him in a
              cavern beneath the Ocean, where during nine years he employed himself in manufacturing
              for them various ornaments and trinkets<note place="bottom">II. xviii. 394. <hi
                  rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. We are not informed how his return to Olympos was
              effected, but we find him in the Ilias firmly fixed there ; and all the houses,
              furniture, ornaments, and arms of the Olympians were the work of his hands.</p>
            <p>It would be an almost endless task to enumerate all the articles formed by
              Hephæstos ; we shall however notice some of the chief of them. One thing is remarkable
              concerning them, that they were all made of the various metals ; no wood, or stone, or
              any other substance, entering into their composition : they were moreover frequently
              endowed with automatism.</p>
            <p>All the habitations of the gods on Olympos were made by Hephæstos, and were all
              composed of metal ; as also were their chariots and arms. He made armour for Achilleus
              and other mortal heroes<note place="bottom">II. viii. 195.</note>. The fatal collar of
              Harmonia was the work of his hands<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 4, 3.</note>. The
              brass-footed, brass-throated, fire-breathing bulls of Æetes king of Colchis were the
              gift of Hephæstos to Æetes’ father Helios<note place="bottom">Apoll. Rh. iii.
                230.</note> ; and he made for Alcinoös, king of the Phæacians, the gold and silver

              gave to Minôs, king of Crete, the brazen man Talôs, who each day compassed his island

            <p>The only instances we meet of Hephæstos’ working in any <pb n="109" xml:id="p109"

            <p>In the Ilias<note place="bottom">II. xviii. 382.</note> the wife of Hephæstos is

              Pallas-Athene in marriage of Zeus, who gave him permission to win her if he could.
              Hephæstos was a rough wooer, and attempted to offer violence to the goddess. An
              Athenian legend refers the birth of Erichthonios, one of the mythic kings of Attica,
              to this circumstance<note place="bottom">See below, Part II. chap. vi.</note>.</p>
            <p>The favourite haunt of Hephæstos on earth was the isle of Lemnos. It was here he fell
              when flung from heaven by Zeus for attempting to aid his mother Hera, whom Zeus had
              suspended in the air with anvils fastened to her feet. As knowledge of the earth
              advanced, Ætna<note place="bottom">Æsch. Prom. 366.</note>, Hiera (one of the Liparæan
                isles)<note place="bottom">Strabo, vi. 2. Sch. Apoll. Rh. iii. 42.</note>, and all
              other places where there was subterranean fire, were regarded as the forges of
              Hephæstos ; and the Cyclopes were associated with him as his assistants. In Homer,
              when Thetis wants Hephæstian armour for her son, she seeks Olympos, and the armour is
              fashioned by the artist-god with his own hand. In the Augustan age, Venus prevails on
              her husband, the master-smith, to furnish her son Æneas with arms ; and he goes down
              from Heaven to Hiera, and directs his men the Cyclopes to execute the order<note
                place="bottom">Æneis, viii. 407. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. It is thus that
              mythology changes with modes of life.</p>
            <p>Hephæstos and Pallas-Athene are frequently joined together as the communicators to
              men of the arts which embellish life and promote civilization<note place="bottom">Od.

              correct and elegant.</p>
            <pb n="110" xml:id="p110"/><p>The artist-god is usually represented as of ripe age, with
              a serious countenance and muscular form : his hair hangs in curls on his shoulders. He
              generally appears with hammer and tongs at his anvil, in a short tunic, and his right
              arm bare, sometimes with a pointed cap on his head. The Cyclopes are occasionally
              placed with him.</p>
            <p>The poetic epithets of Hephæstos were derived either from his lameness or from his
              skill. He was called<note place="bottom">1. ἀμϕιγυήει<hi rend="i">ς</hi> : 2.

            <p>Hephæstos must have been regarded originally as simply the fire-god, a view of his
              character which we find even in the Ilias<note place="bottom">II. xx. 73 ; xxi. 330.
                  <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> His name is also synonymous with <hi rend="i">fire</hi>,

              working the metals, the fire-god naturally became an artist. The former was probably
              Hephæstos’ Pelasgian, the latter his Achæan character. The simplest derivation of his
              name therefore seems to be that which, regarding the first letter as euphonie, and
              Hephæstos as Phæstos (Φα<hi rend="i">ȋ</hi>το<hi rend="i">ς</hi>), deduces it from

              Lycia. The sun was shining fiercely, and the goddess was parched with thirst. She saw
              a pool, and knelt down at it to drink. Some clowns, who were there cutting sedge and
              rushes, refused to allow her to slake her thirst. In vain the goddess entreated,
              representing that water was common to all, and appealing to their compassion for her
              babes. The brutes were insensible : they not only mocked at her distress, but jumped
              into and muddied the water. The goddess, though the most gentle of her race, was
              roused to indignation : she raised her hand to heaven and cried, “May you live for
              ever in that pool !” Her wish was instantly accomplished, and the churls were turned

            <p>Niobe, the daughter of Tantalos and wife of Amphiôn, proud of her numerous offspring,

            <p>With respect to the origin of this goddess and her name, the most simple hypothesis,

              correspond with this hypothesis ; for light, which is made to spring from darkness,
              may, in a reversed order, be regarded as its origin. The epithet ‘sable-vested<note

            <p>As in Homer and Hesiod no birth-place of any of the gods is noticed, we must regard
              the tale of the birth of Phœbos-Apollo in the isle of Delos as being posterior to the
              time of these poets. According to the Homeridian hymn in his honour, it took place in
              the following manner. Leto, persecuted by Hera, besought all the islands of the Ægæan
              to afford her a place of rest ; but all feared too much the potent queen of heaven to
              assist her rival. Delos alone consented to become the birth-place of the future god,
              provided Leto would pledge herself that he would not contemn her humble isle, and
              would erect there the temple vowed by his mother. Leto assented with an oath, and the
              friendly isle received her. For nine days and nights the pains of labour continued.
              All the goddesses, save Hera and Eileithyia, (whom the art of Hera kept in ignorance
              of this great event,) were assembled in the isle. Moved with compassion for the
              sufferings of Leto, they dispatched Iris to Olympos, who brought Eileithyia secretly
              to Delos. Leto then grasped a palm-tree in the soft mead, on the banks of the Inopos,
              Earth smiled around, Apollo sprang to light, and the goddesses shouted aloud to
              celebrate his birth. They washed and swathed the infant deity, and Themis gave him
              nectar and ambrosia. As soon as he had tasted the divine food, his bands and
              swaddling-clothes no longer retained him : he sprang up, and called to the goddesses
              to give him a <pb n="115" xml:id="p115"/>lyre and a bow, adding that he would
              thenceforth declare to men the will of Zeus. He then, to the amazement of the
              assembled goddesses, walked firmly on the ground ; and Delos, exulting with joy,
              became covered with golden flowers<note place="bottom">Hymn to the Delian Apollo. See
                Theognis, 5-10. Eur. Hec. 457. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> We may observe that the tale
                of Delos having been an invisible or floating island, does not appear to have been
                devised when this hymn was composed. We meet the latter notion first in Pindar (Fr.
                Prosod. 2.).</note>.</p>
            <p>Callimachus<note place="bottom">Hymn to Delos.</note> relates the birth of Apollo
              somewhat differently. According to him, Hera, knowing that the son of Leto would be
              dearer to Zeus than her own son Ares, was resolved if possible to prevent his birth.
              Determined therefore that no place should receive the travailing goddess, she took her
              own station in the sky : she placed her son Ares upon the Thracian mountain Hæmos, and
              her messenger Iris on Mount Mimas, to watch the islands. All the lands, hills, and
              rivers of Hellas refused to hearken to the prayers of the goddess. Moved with wrath,
              the unborn Apollo menaced Thebes for her discourteous refusal, and foretold the future
              fate of the children of Niobe. The river-god Peneios alone valued justice and humanity
              more than the wrath of Hera : he checked his stream to give a shelter to the goddess ;
              but instantly Ares arose, clashed his arms, that the mountains and all Thessaly
              trembled at the sound, and was about to fling the peaks of Pangæos on the generous
              stream, who undauntedly awaited the issue ; when Leto passed further on, entreating
              him not to expose himself to danger on her account. She now turned to the islands, but
              none would receive her ; and the god called out to her that a floating island was to
              be his birth-place. At length she met Delos, then called Asteria, which floated among
              the Cyclades<note place="bottom">Compare Virg. Æn. iii. 75.</note>. Delos generously
              invited the wearied goddess to enter her, expressing her willingness to encounter the
              anger of Hera. This last goddess, when informed by her messenger, remits her anger ;
              Apollo is born ; a choir of swans comes from the Mæonian Pactolos, and flies seven
              times round the isle to celebrate his birth ; the Delian nymphs receive and sing the
              sacred verses of Eileithyia ; the sky gives back the joyful cry ; and Delos, as
              before, becomes invested in gold.</p>
            <pb n="116" xml:id="p116"/><p>In the Homeridian hymn to the Pythian Apollo, the manner
              of his first getting possession of Pytho is thus related. When Apollo resolved to
              choose the site of his first temple, he came down from Olympos into Pieria : he sought
              throughout all Thessaly ; thence went to Eubœa, Attica, and Bœotia, but could find no
              place to his mind. The situation of Tilphussa, near Lake Copaïs, in Bœotia, pleased
              him ; and he was about to lay the foundations of his temple there, when the nymph of
              the place, afraid of having her own fame eclipsed by the vicinity of the oracle of
              Apollo, dissuaded him, by representing how much his oracle would be disturbed by the
              noise of the horses and mules coming to water at her stream. She recommends to him
              Crissa beneath Mount Parnassos as a quiet sequestered spot, where no unseemly sounds
              would disturb the holy silence demanded by an oracle. Arrived at Crissa, the god is
              charmed by the solitude and sublimity of the scene. He forthwith sets about erecting a
              temple, which the hands of numerous workmen speedily raise, under the direction of the
              brothers Trophonios and Agamedes. Meanwhile Apollo slays with his arrows the monstrous
              serpent which abode there and destroyed the people and cattle of the vicinity. As she
              lay expiring, the exulting victor cried, “Now <hi rend="i">rot</hi> (<hi rend="i"
                >πύθευ</hi>) there on the man-feeding earth ;” and hence the place and oracle
              received the appellation of Pytho. The fane was now erected, but priests were wanting.
              The god, as he stood on the lofty area of the temple, cast his eyes over the sea, and
              beheld far south of the Peloponnese a Cretan ship sailing for Pylos. He plunged into
              the sea, and in the form of a porpoise sprang on board the ship. The crew sat in
              terror and amazement : a south-wind carried the vessel rapidly along : in vain they
              sought to land at Tænaron ; she would not obey the helm. When they came to the bay of
              Crissa a west-wind sprang up, and speedily brought the ship into port ; and the god in
              the form of a blazing star left the vessel, and descended into his temple. Then quick
              as thought he came as a handsome youth with long locks waving on his shoulders, and
              accosted the strangers, inquiring who they were and whence they came. To their
              question in return, of what that place was to which they were come, he replies by
              informing them <pb n="117" xml:id="p117"/>who he is, and what his purpose was in
              bringing them thither. He invites them to land, and says, that as he had met them in
              the form of a porpoise (<hi rend="i">δε</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ὶν</hi>) they should worship
              him as Apollo Delphinios, whence the place should also derive its name<note

            <p>As might be expected, the legends of so celebrated an event as the establishment of
              the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, the sacred counsellor of all Greece, are various. The
              names Pytho and Delphi alone sufficed to give a foundation for some of them. The
              former, which evidently signifies the <hi rend="i">Place of Enquiry</hi>, a title well
              suited to an oracle, gave occasion to the legend above related, and also to one of a
              huge serpent named Pythôn, which, it is said, came out of his den and attacked Leto
              when she was going by with her children in her arms ; she stood then on a rock,
              holding the infant Artemis, and urged on her son by calling to him, <hi rend="i">ἵε,
                παî</hi>, and he dispatched the monster with his arrows<note place="bottom">Eur.

              for the formation of which name, as we may perceive, Delphi probably gave its aid, as
              it did also for that of the change of the god into the porpoise, and for his title
              Delphinios.</p>
            <p>The Homeric Apollo is a being of remarkable purity, and the poet seems to have had a
              strong feeling of the dignity of his character, for he never ventures to use the same
              familiarity with him as with the other gods, Zeus himself not excepted. Apollo is the
              friend of man, he protects his worshipers, and he punishes the unjust and impious. At
              all periods of the <pb n="118" xml:id="p118"/>Grecian literature we find the character
              of the ‘pure (<hi rend="i">ἁγνὸς</hi>) god,’ as he was emphatically called, still the
              same. There is a serene cheerfulness always ascribed to him, he is averse from gloom
              and the promoter of joy and innocent pleasure<note place="bottom">Æschyl. Agam. 1083.
                Callim. Hymn to Apollo, 20. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Plut. De Ei. 20.</note>; but at
              the same time dignified in his sentiments and actions. The purity of his character
              appears also in this, that no amours with either goddesses or mortals are ascribed to
              him in the Homeric poems<note place="bottom">Il. ix. 557, may seem to form an
                exception, but see the Appendix.</note>. When however, in subsequent times, heroes
              and heroic families were made to derive their lineage from the residents of Olympos,
              Phœbos-Apollo was also provided with his love-adventures by the poets ; yet it is
              observable that he was not remarkably happy in his love, either meeting with a
              repulse, or having his amour attended with a fatal termination, and that none of these
              heroic families could claim him as the head of their genealogy.</p>
            <p>«The first love of Phœbos,» says Ovid, «was Daphne, the daughter of Peneios.» Apollo,
              proud of his victory over the Pythôn, beholding Erôs bending his bow, mocked at the
              efforts of the puny archer. Erôs incensed flew, and taking his stand on Parnassos shot
              his golden arrow of love into the heart of the son of Leto, and discharged his leaden
              one of aversion into the bosom of the nymph of Peneios. Daphne loved the chase, and it
              alone, indifferent to all other love. Phœbos beheld her, and burned with passion. She
              flies, he pursues ; in vain he exhausts his eloquence, magnifying his rank, his power,
              his possessions ; the nymph but urges her speed the more. Fear gave wings to the
              nymph, love to the god. Exhausted and nearly overtaken, Daphne on the banks of her
              father’s stream stretched forth her hands, calling on Pencios for protection and
              change of form. The river-god heard ; bark and leaves covered his daughter, and Daphne
              became a <hi rend="i">bay-tree (δάϕνη, laurus).</hi> The god embraced its trunk, and
              declared that it should be ever afterwards his favourite tree<note place="bottom"
                >Ovid, Met. i. 452. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Hygin. 203. The great majority of the
                authorities place the legend in Arcadia, making Daphne the daughter of the Ladôn by
                Earth (the natural parent of a plant), and add that it was her mother that changed
                her on her prayer. Paus. vlii. 20. 4. Nonnus, xlii. 387. Eudocia, 106. 273. Sch. Il.

                however, much more closely connected with the Peneios and Tempe than with the Ladôn
                and Arcadia.</note>.</p>
            <pb n="119" xml:id="p119"/><p>Of this legend we need only observe, that it is one of the
              many tales devised to give marvel to the origin of natural productions, and that its
              object is to account for the bay-tree being sacred to Apollo.</p>
            <p>Apollo, it is also said by the same poet, thought himself happy in the love and
              fidelity of Coronis, a maiden of Larissa. His ignorance was his bliss, for the nymph
              was faithless. The raven, the favourite bird of the god, and then white as his swans,
              saw the maiden in the arms of a Hæmonian youth, and bore the tidings to his master,
              who immediately discharged one of his inevitable arrows into the bosom of the frail
              fair one. Dying she deplores the fate, not of herself, but of her unborn babe. The god
              repents when too late ; he tries in vain his healing art, and, dropping celestial
              tears, places her on the funereal pyre : extracting the babe, he gave him to be reared
              by Cheirôn, the centaur. To punish the raven, he changed his hue from white to
                black<note place="bottom">Ovid, Met. ii. 542. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>This is probably a legend of some antiquity, for in a fragment of one of the poems
              ascribed to Hesiod<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Ap.</hi> Sch. Pind. Pyth. iii. 14.
                48.</note>, it is said that the raven brought tidings to Phœbos of the marriage of
              Ischys, the son of Eilatos, with Coronis, the daughter of Phlegyas. The tale is also
              told by Pindar<note place="bottom">Pyth. iii. 14. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>, but
              he says nothing of the raven, making the god himself, though at Pytho, discover what
              was done through his divine power. At his desire Artemis shot the fair offender with
              her arrows.</p>
            <p>Marpessa, the daughter of Evenos, was beloved by Apollo, whose suit was favoured by
              her father. Idas, another lover, having obtained a winged chariot from Poseidôn,
              carried off the apparently not reluctant maid. Her father pursued the fugitives, but
              coming to the river Lycormas, and finding his progress stopped by it, he slew his
              horses and cast himself into the stream, which from him derived its name Evenos.
              Meantime Apollo met and took the fair prize from Idas. The matter being referred to
              Zeus, he allowed the maiden to choose <pb n="120" xml:id="p120"/>for herself ; and
              fearing that when she grew old Apollo would desert her, she wisely chose to match with
              her equal, and gave her hand to her mortal lover<note place="bottom">Apollod. i. l. 7.

                Damayanti acts in the same manner as Marpessa, and on the same
              principle.</note>.</p>
            <p>Cassandra, daughter of Priamos king of Troy, also attracted the love of this god :
              the price she set on her favours was the gift of prophecy. The gift was freely given,
              but the royal maid refused the promised return ; and the indignant deity, unable to
              recall what he had bestowed, made it useless by depriving her predictions of
                credit<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 12.</note>.</p>
            <p>Cyrene, a daughter of the river Peneios, was another of the loves of Phœbos ; he

                mythic account of its origin.</note>.</p>
            <p>The babe saved from the pyre of Coronis was Asclepios, who became so famous for his
              healing powers. Extending them so far as to restore the dead to life, he drew on
              himself the enmity of Hades, on whose complaint Zeus with his thunder deprived him of
              life. Apollo incensed slew the Cyclopes who had forged the thunderbolts, for which
              bold deed Zeus was about to hurl him down to Tartaros, but, on the entreaty of Leto,
              he was so far mollified as to be content with the offender’s becoming a servant to a
              mortal man for the space of a year. Admetos, king of Pheræ, in Thessaly, was the
              person selected to be honoured by the service of the god, who, according to the more
              dignified and probable view of the mythe, pastured this prince’s flocks and herds on
              the verdant banks of the river Amphrysos, making the kine under his charge all bear

            <p>In this mythic tale of Apollo serving Admetos, Müller sees matter of deeper import
              than might at first sight be supposed. According to the Delphian tradition, it was for
              slaying the Pythôn that the god was condemned to servitude. Every <pb n="122"
                xml:id="p122"/>eighth year the combat with the Pythôn was the subject of mimic
              representation at Delphi. A boy who personated Apollo, having in mimic show slain the
              Pythôn, fled and took his way along the Sacred Road to the vale of Tempe in the north
              of Thessaly, to be purified as it were from the guilt of the bloodshed ; and having
              there plucked a branch of bay, in imitation of the act of the god, he returned to
              Delphi at the head of a <hi rend="i">theoria</hi><note place="bottom">Pindar and
                Callimachus <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Tertul. De Cor. Mil. 7.</note>. This mimic flight
              also represented the servitude of the god, which the legend placed at Pheræ in
                Thessaly<note place="bottom">Plut. De Def. Orac. 15. 21. Q. G. 12. Ælian. V. H. iii.
                l.</note>. Müller therefore, who views in the whole transaction a deep moral sense,
              and a design to impress upon the minds of men a vivid idea of the guilt of bloodshed,
              by representing even the pure god Apollo as being punished for slaying the Pythôn, a
              being of demon-origin, deems the original legend to have been a still bolder stretch
              of fancy, and that it was to the god of the under-world, to Hades himself, that Apollo
              was obliged to become a servant<note place="bottom">The same notion is expressed in
                Plutarch (De Def. Or. 21.) if the reading given by Wyttembach from Eusebius be the
                true one, as it most probably is.</note>. This hypothesis he thinks is confirmed by
              the names which occur in the legend : for Admetos, he says, must have been an epithet
              of Hades ; Clymene, the name of Admetos’ mother, is one of Persephone ; and Pheræ was
              a town sacred to the goddess Hecate, who was connected with the lower-world<note

            <p>It cannot be said positively whether this mythe (which is apparently a temple-legend
              of Delphi,) was known to Homer. In the Catalogue<note place="bottom">Il. ii.
                763.</note> the mares of Eumelos Pheretiades are highly praised for their beauty and
              swiftness, and it is added that Apollo had reared them in Pieria<note place="bottom"
                >The Venetian MS. (which is followed by Wolf) reads Π<hi rend="i">ηϵρίע</hi> for

              son of Admetos, is one of the competitors in the chariotrace. These notices however,
              we may observe, occur in the <pb n="123" xml:id="p123"/>parts of the Hias of which the
              antiquity is most dubious. It may also be doubted if the temple-legend of Delphi could
              be as old as the age to which Homer is usually referred. In another of the latter
              books of the Ilias it is said that Poseidôn and Apollo, by the command of Zeus (we
              know not why given), served Laomedôn, king of Troy, for a year ; at the end of which
              time he refused to pay them their wages, and threatened to cut off the cars of both,
              and even to sell the latter for a slave. The task of Apollo had been to tend the herds
              of the Trojan king in the valleys of Ida<note place="bottom">Il. xxi. 442. <hi

              his half-brother Hermes. Pan, the god of shepherds, venturing to set his reed-music in
              opposition to the lyre of Apollo, was pronounced overcome by Mount Tmolos, who had
              been chosen judge ; and all present approved the decision except king Midas, whose

              the tears of the nymphs and rural gods for the fate of their companion gave origin to

              service of the gods ; the lyre was used by the Greeks in that of Apollo<note

            <p>The Homeric Apollo is a personage totally distinct from Helios, though probably, as
              will shortly appear, originally the same. When mysteries and secret doctrines were
              introduced into Greece, these deities were united, or perhaps we might say re-united.
              Apollo at the same period also took the place of Pæeôn, and became the god of the
              healing art<note place="bottom">Eur. Alc. 990. Plato, Critias. Hermann, Ueber das
                Wesen, etc., 108. See below, chap. xiii. <hi rend="i">Pæôn.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>This god was a favourite object of Grecian worship, and his temples were numerous. Of
              these the most celebrated were that of Delphi in Phocis, — his acquisition of which we
              have above related, and where, as the mythe of Pythôn would seem to intimate, a
              conflict took place between the religion of Apollo, proceeding southwards from Pieria,
              or westwards from Delos, and the ancient religion of the place, the worship of Gæa or
                Themis<note place="bottom">See Æsch. Eumen. 1. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Sch. <hi
                  rend="i">in loc.</hi></note>, — and those of Delos, of Patara in Lycia, Claros in
              Ionia, Grynion in Æolis, Didyma at Miletus ; in all of which his oracles revealed the
              future.</p>
            <p>A very able mythologist of the present day<note place="bottom">Müller, Dorians, vol.
                i. book ii.</note> maintains that the worship of Apollo was originally peculiar to
              the Dorian race, who were at all times his most zealous votaries. As the Homeric poems
              prove the worship of this deity to have been common to the Achæan race, and well known
              on the coasts of Asia long before the Dorian migration, the critic is forced to have
              recourse to the not very probable supposition of a Dorian colony having left the
              mountains of Thessaly many years before the Trojan war, and carried the
              Apollo-religion to Crete, whence it was spread to the coast of Asia, and also conveyed
              to Delos and Delphi. We cannot assent to this theory. Apollo seems to have been one of
              the original gods <pb n="125" xml:id="p125"/>of the Grecian race ; and he was
              worshiped by one people more than another, on the same principle as in India Vishnoo
              is in some places more worshiped than Seeva ; Thor was most honoured by the ancient
              Norwegians, and Odin by the Swedes ; St. Jago is more frequently invoked in Spain, and
              St. Anthony in Italy, — without the existence and the rights of the others being
                denied<note place="bottom">See Höck, Kreta, vol. ii.</note>.</p>
            <p>Apollo was supposed to visit his various favourite abodes at different seasons of the

            <p>One of the most beautiful descriptions of these progresses of Apollo was that given
              by the lyric poet Alcæus. The poem has unfortunately perished, but we find the
              following analysis of it in the works of the sophist Himerius<note place="bottom">Or.
                xiv. 10. Voss, M. B. ii. 109.</note>.</p>
            <p>«When Apollo was born, Zeus adorned him with a golden headband and lyre, and gave him
              moreover a team to drive (the team were swans)<note place="bottom">Claudian (De VI.
                Con. Honor. 30.) makes his team on this occasion griffons.</note>. He then sent him
              to Delphi and the streams of Castalia, thence to declare prophetically right and
              justice to the Hellenes. He ascended the car, and desired the swans to fly also to the
                Hyperboreans<note place="bottom">See above, p. 34.</note>. The Delphians, when they
              perceived this, arranged a Pæan and song, and setting choirs of youths around the
              tripod, called on the god to come from the Hyperboreans. Having given laws for a whole
              year among those men, when the time was come which he had appointed for the Delphic
              tripods also to resound, he directed his swans to fly back from the Hyperboreans. It
              was then summer, and the very middle of it, when Alcæus leads Apollo back from the
              Hyperboreans ; for when summer <pb n="126" xml:id="p126"/>shines and Apollo journeys,
              the lyre itself whispers in a summer-tone of the god. The nightingales sing to him, as
              the birds should sing in Aleæus ; the swallows and cicadas also sing, not narrating
              their own fate when among men, but tuning all their melodies to the god. Castalia too
              flows with poetic silver streams, and Cephissos swells high and bright with his waves,
              emulating the Enipeus of Homer. For, like Homer. Alcæus ventures to make the very
              water capable of perceiving the access of the god.»</p>
            <p>It was probably on account of their pure white hue that the swans were assigned to
              the pure god Phœbos-Apollo ; and this connection with the god of music gave origin to
              the fable, as it is esteemed, of the melody of these birds<note place="bottom">There
                seems however to be some foundation for it. A naturalist of the present day says,
                «This species of swan deserves the title <hi rend="i">Musicus</hi> ; for when in
                small troops they fly aloft in the air their melodious melancholy voices sound like
                trumpets heard in the distance.» — Faber, Geschichte der Vögel Islands, 1822, quoted
                by Finn Magnusen (Edda Sæmundar, iii. 530), whose own words are, «Cygnorum cantus
                dulcissimus in Islandia, Scotia, et pluribus regionibus sæpissime auditur, <hi
                  rend="i">quod etiam nosmet, propria experientia edocti, attestari possumus.</hi>»
                We have ourselves heard the trumpet-tones of a swan. See Voss. Myth. Br. ii.
                132.</note>. The wolf was also assigned to this god, on account of his bright
              colour, as some think, but it is far more likely that it was the similitude of his
              name to an epithet of the god which gave occasion to it. The noisy chirping <hi
                rend="i">tettix (cicada)</hi>, or tree-hopper, was naturally associated with the god
              of music ; and as the god of augury Apollo was the patron of the hawk and raven. The
              bay-tree was the plant dedicated to this deity.</p>
            <p>Apollo was represented by the artists in the perfection of united manly strength and
              beauty. His long curling hair hangs loose, or bound with the <hi rend="i"
                >strophium</hi> behind ; his brows are wreathed with bay ; in his hands he bears his
              bow or lyre. The wonderful Apollo Belvidere shows at the same time the conception
              which the ancients had of this benign deity, and the high degree of perfection to
              which they had attained in sculpture.</p>
            <p>Few deities had more appellations than the son of Leto. He was called Delian,
              Delphian, Pataræan, Clarian, etc. from the places of his worship ; and Smynthian from
              a Phrygian word signifying <hi rend="i">mouse</hi>, of which animal a legend said he
              had <pb n="127" xml:id="p127"/>been the destroyer in Troas. He was also styled<note

            <p>This god had several epithets apparently connected with the Greek name of the wolf
                (λ<hi rend="i">ύκος</hi>) ; but as there was an ancient Greek word signifying <hi
                rend="i">light</hi> (Λϒ ΚH)<note place="bottom">This word is connected with <hi
                  rend="i">λϵυκςὸ, white</hi>, and with the Latin <hi rend="i">lux, luceo</hi>, and
                the Teutonic <hi rend="i">Licht</hi> and <hi rend="i">Light.</hi> The terms <hi
                  rend="i">ἀμϕίλυκη</hi> and <hi rend="i">λυκάβας</hi> prove, we think, the former
                existence of ΛϒΚΗ. See Müller, <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> 325.<hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi></note>, of a similar form, the great probability, in the eyes of all who
              regard Apollo as the sun-god, or as a moral being of great purity, will be that this
              last is the real root of these names, and that, as we said above, it was merely
              similarity of sound that caused the wolf, or the country Lycia, to be regarded as
              their origin. Thus the god is called by Homer <hi rend="i">λυκγϵυὴς</hi>, which may be
              rendered with the utmost propriety <hi rend="i">Light-born</hi>,<note place="bottom"
                >Some would derive it from <hi rend="i">λύγη, darkness.</hi></note> whereas the
              usual interpretation, <hi rend="i">Lycia-born</hi>, contradicts the fact of the
              Homeric gods not having birth-places on earth. Two other epithets of Apollo, <hi
                rend="i">λύκιος</hi> and <hi rend="i">λύκϵιος</hi>, which are usually rendered <hi
                rend="i">Lycian</hi>, or <hi rend="i">Wolf-destroying</hi>, or rather <hi rend="i"
                >Wolfish</hi>, may signify <hi rend="i">Lighted</hi>, or <hi rend="i">Lighting.</hi>
              There are two others (<hi rend="i">λυκοκτόνος</hi> and <hi rend="i">λυκοϵργὴς</hi>)
              which evidently signify <hi rend="i">Wolf-killing</hi>, but they are of late origin,
              and formed after the derivation from <hi rend="i">λύκιος, wolf</hi>, had become the
              prevalent one.</p>
            <p>Apollo was also named Agyieus (Ἀ<hi rend="i">γυιϵὺς</hi>), as the guardian of the
              streets and roads (<hi rend="i">ἀγυιαί</hi>). Stone-pillars with pointed heads, placed
              before the doors of the houses, were the images of the god under this name. This
              practice was peculiar to the Dorians<note place="bottom">Sch. Aristoph. Wasps, 875.
                Sch. Eurip. Phœn. 640.</note>. Apollo was called Pæan, either from his healing power
              (from <hi rend="i">παύω</hi> or ΠΑΩ), in which case he would <pb n="128" xml:id="p128"
              />be identical with Pæeôn ; or from his protecting and avenging character (from <hi
                rend="i">παίω</hi>) The hymn sung to him on the cessation of a plague, or after a
              victory, was thus named.</p>
            <p>The name Phœbos-Apollo is generally regarded as of Grecian origin. The former part
              critics are unanimous in deriving from <hi rend="i">ϕάω, to shine</hi> ; of which the
              advocates for the original identity of this deity with Helios see at once the
              appropriateness : the maintainers of the contrary system interpret Phœbos <hi rend="i"
                >pure, unstained</hi>, making it equivalent to the ἁγνὸς θϵὸς, as he is sometimes
                called<note place="bottom">Müller, Dorians, i. 324.</note>. Apollo is by some
              derived from ὄλω, <hi rend="i">to destroy</hi> ; by others from an old verb
              ἀπέλλω, akin to the Latin <hi rend="i">pello, to drive away</hi> ; by others
              again from ἀέλιος, <hi rend="i">the sun</hi>, with the digamma F between the
              two first vowels. The strangest etymon of all is that of Buttmann, who, taking the
              Cretan form ᾽<hi rend="i">Αβ</hi>έλ<hi rend="i">ιος</hi> to be the original
              one, deduces it, according to his system of tracing the Greek religion from the East,
              from Jabal and Jubal, the first musician and herdsman according to Scripture<note

            <p>Callimachus thus relates the early history of the goddess<note place="bottom">Hymn to
                Artemis.</note>.</p>
            <p>Artemis while yet a child, as she sat on her father’s knee, besought him to grant her
              permission to lead a life of perpetual virginity, to get a bow and arrows formed by
              the Cyclopes, and to devote herself to the chase. She further asked for sixty
              Ocean-nymphs as her companions, and twenty nymphs from Amnisos in Crete as her
              attendants. Of towns and cities she required not more than one, satisfied with the
              mountains, which she never would leave but to aid women in the pains of child-birth.
              Her indulgent sire assented with a smile, and gave her not one but thirty towns. She
              speeds to Crete, and thence to Ocean, and selects all her nymphs. On her return she
              calls at Lipara on Hephæstos and the Cyclopes, who immediately lay aside all their
              work to execute her orders. She now proceeds to Arcadia, where Pan, the chief god of
              that country, supplies her with dogs of an excellent breed. Mount Parrhasios then
              witnessed the first exploit of <pb n="130" xml:id="p130"/>the huntress-goddess. Five
              deer larger than bulls, with horns of gold, fed on the banks of the ‘dark-pebbled’
              Anauros at the foot of that hill : of these the goddess unaided by her dogs caught
              four, which she reserved to draw her chariot : the fifth, destined by Hera for the
              last labour of Heracles, bounded across the Keladôn and escaped.</p>
            <p>According to the same poet, the chariot of Artemis and the harness of her deer are
              all of gold. When she drives to the house of Zeus, the gods come forth to meet her.
              Hermes takes her bow and arrows, and Apollo used to carry in her game, till Heracles
              was received into Olympos, when for his strength that office devolved on him. He
              carries in the bull, or boar, or whatever else she may have brought, exhorting the
              goddess to let the hares and small game alone, and attach herself to the boars and
              oxen ; for Heracles, the poet observes, though deified, still retains his appetite.
              The Amnisiades then unyoke her stags, and bring to them from Hera’s mead some of the
              trefoil on which the horses of Zeus feed, and fill their golden troughs with water.
              The goddess herself meantime enters the house of her father, and sits beside her
              brother Apollo.</p>
            <p>The adventures of Artemis were not numerous. She turned, as we shall relate below,
              Actæôn into a stag, for having unconsciously beheld her when bathing<note

              Grecian fleet at Aulis, in consequence of Agamemnôn’s having killed a hind which was
              sacred to her, and to have required the sacrifice of his daughter Iphigeneia. The
              Aloeids, Otos and Ephialtes, it was said, sought in marriage Hera and Artemis : the
              latter goddess, changing her form into that of a hind, sprang out between the two
              brothers, who aiming their darts at the supposed beast, by her art pierced each other
              and died<note place="bottom">Apollod. i. 7. Callim. Hymn iii. 264. Below, Part II.

            <pb n="131" xml:id="p131"/><p>We have already noticed the practice of the Greeks to
              unite similar deities, or to make one of them principal, and the others companions or
              attendants ; and also to form nymphs and other subordinate beings attached to the
              service of the gods out of their epithets. Of these practices Artemis furnishes more
              examples perhaps than any other deity.</p>
            <p>The Cretans worshiped a goddess the same as or very similar to Artemis, whom they
              named Britomartis, which in their dialect signified <hi rend="i">Sweet Maid.</hi> She
              was also called Dictynna, a goddess of that name, and of a similar nature, having been
              perhaps united with her. There was a similar deity named Aphæa worshiped at Ægina, and
              they were all joined in a legend in the following manner.</p>
            <p>The Cretan nymph Britomartis, the daughter of Zeus and Charme, was a favourite
              companion of Artemis. Minôs falling in love with her, pursued her for the space of
              nine months, the nymph at times concealing herself from him amidst the trees, at times
              among the reeds and sedge of the marshes. At length, being nearly overtaken by him,
              she sprang from a cliff into the sea, where she was saved in the nets (<hi rend="i"
                >δίκτυα</hi>) of some fishermen. The Cretans afterwards worshiped her as a goddess
              under the name of <hi rend="i">Dictynna</hi> from the above circumstance, which also
              was assigned as the reason of the cliff from which she threw herself being called <hi
                rend="i">Dictæon.</hi> At the rites sacred to her, wreaths of pine or lentisk were
              used instead of myrtle, as a branch of the latter had caught her garments and impeded
              her flight. Leaving Crete, Britomartis then sailed for Ægina in a boat : the boatman
              attempted to offer her violence, but she got to shore and took refuge in a grove on
              that island, where she became invisible (<hi rend="i">ἀϕανὴς</hi>) : hence she was
              worshiped in Ægina under the name of Aphæa<note place="bottom">Callim. Hymn iii. 189.

            <p>The well-known legend of Alpheios and Arethusa offers another remarkable instance of
              this procedure.</p>
            <p>Arethusa, it is said, was an Arcadian nymph, and a companion of the huntress-goddess.
              As she was one day returning from the chase she came to the clear stream of the
              Alpheios, and enticed by its beauty stripped herself and entered it, <pb n="132"
                xml:id="p132"/>to drive away the heat and the fatigue. She heard a murmur in the
              stream, and terrified sprang to land. The river-god rose : she fled away naked as she
              was ; Alpheios pursued her. She sped all through Arcadia, till with the approach of
              evening she felt her strength to fail, and saw that her pursuer was close upon her.
              She then prayed to Artemis for relief, and was immediately dissolved into a fountain.
              Alpheios resumed his aqueous form, and sought to mingle his waters with hers. She fled
              on under the earth and through the sea, till she rose in the isle of Ortygia at
              Syracuse, still followed by the amorous stream<note place="bottom">Ovid, Met. v. 572.
                  <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Moschus, Idyl. vii.</note>.</p>
            <p>The explanation of this mythe is as follows<note place="bottom">See Müller, Proleg.
                135. Dorians, i. 393.</note>. Artemis was worshiped in Elis under the titles of
              Alpheiæa, Alpheioa, Alpheionia, and Alpheiusa<note place="bottom">Paus. vi. 22, 8-10.
                Strab. viii. 3. Athen. viii. 346.</note> ; and there was a common altar to her and
              Alpheios within the precincts of the Altis at Olympia<note place="bottom">Above,
                p. 77.</note>. When in the fifth Olympiad Archias the Corinthian founded the colony
              of Syracuse in Sicily, there were among the colonists some members of the sacerdotal
              family of the Iamids of Olympia<note place="bottom">Pind. Ol. vi. 8.</note>. These
              naturally exercised much influence in the religious affairs of the colony, whose first
              seat was the islet of Ortygia. A temple was built there to Artemis <hi rend="i"
                >Of-the-Stream</hi> (Π<hi rend="i">οταμία</hi>), to which perhaps the proximate
              inducement was the presence of the fount Arethusa, which contained large fishes, and
              sent forth a copious stream of water into the sea<note place="bottom">Ibycus <hi

                iv. 53.</note>. From the original connexion between Alpheios and Artemis, the notion
              gradually arose, or it was given out, that the fount contained water of the Alpheios,
              and thence came the legend of his course under the sea<note place="bottom">Ibycus <hi
                  rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch. Theocr. i. 117. Pind. Nem. i. 1.</note>. Eventually, when
              the poetic notion of Artemis as a love-shunning maiden became the prevalent one<note
                place="bottom">Thus the Eleians changed the name of the Alpheiæa of the Letrinæns to
                Elaphiæa (from <hi rend="i">ἔλαϕος</hi>, Paus. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi>).</note>,
              the goddess was made to fly the pursuit of Alpheios<note place="bottom">Telesilla <hi
                  rend="i">ap.</hi> Ursinus. Pind. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi></note>. The legend at
              Letrini was<note place="bottom">Paus. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi></note> that he fell in
              love with <pb n="133" xml:id="p133"/>her, but seeing no chance of success in a lawful
              way he resolved to force her. For this purpose he came to Letrini, where she and her
              nymphs were celebrating a <hi rend="i">pannychis</hi> or wake, and mingled with them.
              But the goddess, suspecting his design, had daubed her own face and those of her
              nymphs with mud, so that he was unable to distinguish her, and thus was foiled.
              Finally she was converted into the coy nymph Arethusa<note place="bottom">It is
                uncertain when this change took place ; it is the goddess who is pursued in
                Telesilla, <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> (O1. 64.). The oracle given to Archias (Paus.
                v. 7, 3.) is probably a late fiction ; it speaks of the fount of Arethusa. Welcker
                (Schwenk. 263.) regards this name as being <hi rend="i">ἂρι-θοῶσα</hi>.
                It may be only a corruption of Alpheiusa.</note>. A late pragmatising form of the
              pleasing mythe was, that Alpheios was a hunter who was in love with the huntress
              Arethusa. To escape from his importunities she passed over to Ortygia, where she was
              changed into a fountain, and Alpheios became a river<note place="bottom">Paus. v. 7,
                2.</note>.</p>
            <p>In proof of the truth of this fable, it was asserted that a cup (<hi rend="i"
                >ϕιάλη</hi>) which fell into the Alpheios rose in Arethusa, whose pellucid waters
              also became turbid with the blood of the victims slain at the Olympic games<note

            <p>We may here observe, that in the Peloponnese the relation between Artemis and the
              water was very intimate. She was worshiped in several places as Limnatis and Heleia,
              and there were frequently fountains in her temples. She was therefore probably
              regarded as a goddess of nature, that gave vigour and growth to plants and animals by
              the means of water<note place="bottom">Müller, Dorians, i. 392.</note>.</p>
            <p>Among the various titles of Artemis were Loxo, Hecaerge, Arge, and Opis, or Upis. She
              bore the two first as the sister of Apollo Loxias and Hecaergos. She was styled Arge
              as the <hi rend="i">swift</hi> or the <hi rend="i">bright</hi> goddess, and Upis or
              Opis as her whose <hi rend="i">eye</hi> was over all. In the isle of Delos however
              were shown the tombs of Opis and Arge behind the temple of Artemis, and the tradition
              of the place was, that they, who were two Hyperborean maidens, had been the companions
              of Apollo and Artemis when they first came to Delos<note place="bottom">Herod. iv.
                35.</note>. According to another account, these Hyperborean maidens were three in
                <pb n="134" xml:id="p134"/>number, and named Upis, Loxo, and Hecaerge<note
                place="bottom">Callim. Hymn to Delos, 392.</note>, while a third named only Opis and
                Hecaerge<note place="bottom">Melanopos of Cyme <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Paus. v. 7,
                8.</note>. There was also a legend of a nymph Arge, who when pursuing a buck cried
              out to him, «Though you should follow the course of the Sun I will overtake you,» at
              which the Sun being offended, turned her into a doe<note place="bottom">Hygin.
                205.</note>. Another legend said that Zeus carried away the nymph Arge from Lyctos
              in Crete to a hill named Argillos on the banks of the Nile, where she became the
              mother of Dionysos<note place="bottom">Plut. de Fluv. xvi. 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>If Artemis was merely one of the names under which the moon was worshiped, it need
              not surprise us to find her identified with Selene, with Hecate, and even with
              Persephone, the goddess of the under-world, and to be thence called the <hi rend="i"
                >three-formed</hi> goddess<note place="bottom">See below, chap. xii. <hi rend="i"
                  >Eileithyiæ.</hi></note> ruling as Selene in the sky, as Artemis on earth, as
              Persephone in Erebos. This will also give a very simple reason for her being like
              Eileithyia, the aider of women in labour. If Artemis was not originally a
              moon-goddess, these identifications become somewhat difficult of solution<note
                place="bottom">Of Artemis-Callisto and Art.-Iphigencia, or Orthia, we shall treat in
                the Second Part.</note>.</p>
            <p>Artemis was also confounded with the goddess worshiped on the Tauric Chersonese,
              whose altars were stained with the blood of such unhappy strangers as were cast on
              that inhospitable shore<note place="bottom">Herod. iv. 103. Eurip. Iph. in
                Taur.</note>. She was identified too with the goddess of nature adored at Ephesus,
              whose symbolical figure, by its multitude of breasts and heads of animals hung round
              it, denoted the fecundity of nature. In Magnesia on the Mæander there was a most
              stately temple of Artemis-Leucophryne (<hi rend="i">White-browed</hi>)<note
                place="bottom">Tacitus, Ann. iii. 62.</note>, in which was shown the tomb of a
              maiden named Leucophryne<note place="bottom">Clem. Alex. Protrept. p. 20. Arnob. adv.
                Centes, 6.</note>, who was probably regarded as bearing a relation to the goddess
              similar to that borne by Upis and Arge at Delos. Leucophryne was therefore no more
              than an epithet of Artemis, who had also a temple at Leucophrys on <pb n="135"
                xml:id="p135"/>the coast<note place="bottom">Xen. Hell. iii. 2. 19 ; iv. 8.
                17.</note> ; and it becomes a question whether (like Artemis of Ephesus, with whom
              she must have been identical) she derived her appellation from that town, whose name
              probably corresponded with its situation on a chalk cliff ; or whether it was
              expressive of her beauty. As however beauty was not an attribute of the Asiatic
              goddess, the former is more likely to be the true supposition<note place="bottom"
                >Buttmann, Mytholog. ii. 133-135.</note>.</p>
            <p>No spot on earth is assigned as the birth-place of Artemis by Homer, in whose time,
              as we have more than once observed, that practice had not yet commenced ; but as he
              mentions the island Ortygia as that in which she shot Oriôn<note place="bottom">Od.
                v. 121.</note>, succeeding poets fabled that she was born there<note place="bottom"
                >Hymn to Delian Apollo, 16. Pind. Nem. i. 1-4. Orph. Hymn xxxv. 5.</note>. This
              island was described by Homer as lying in the western sea, the scene of all wonders,
              and was probably as imaginary as Ogygia, that of Calypso ; but when at a later period
              the Greeks grew more familiar with those distant regions, zeal for the honour of the
              poet who had sung so well the wanderings of Odysseus, and the love of definiteness,
              led them to affix the names which he employs to various places really to be found, and
              the islet at the mouth of the port of Syracuse was determined to be the Ortygia of the
                Odyssey<note place="bottom">See below, chap. xix. <hi rend="i"
              >Ortygia.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Artemis is generally represented as a healthy, strong, active maiden, — handsome, but
              with no gentleness of expression. She wears the Cretan hunting-shoes (ἐ<hi
                rend="i">νδρομίδϵς</hi>), and has her garment tucked up for speed. On her back she
              bears a quiver, and in her hand a bow or a hunting-spear. She is usually attended by a
              dog.</p>
            <p>At Trœzên there was a temple of Artemis-Lycæa, the erection of which was ascribed to
              Hippolytos, but the guides could give Pausanias no account of the unusual title
                Lycæa<note place="bottom">Paus. ii. 31, 4.</note>. Another ambiguous name of this
              goddess was that of Tauropolos<note place="bottom">Soph. Ajax, 172. Eur. Iph. Taur.

            <p>Mythologists are divided into two parties respecting the original nature of Leto and
              her children, the one regarding them as physical, the other as moral beings. Both
              however are agreed that the latter is their character in the Homeric and Hesiodic
              poetry, where, as we have seen, Apollo appears only as the god of prophecy, music and
              archery, and Artemis as his counterpart in this last office. Voss<note place="bottom"

              original conception of these deities, while Heyne<note place="bottom">On 11. i. 50 ;

                >theocrasy</hi> of the ancients, by which Apollo and Artemis were identified with
              Helios and Selene, they were only restored to their original nature and character. We
              have more than once hinted our inclination to regard this last as the more correct
              hypothesis. We will now briefly state the principal arguments on both sides.</p>
            <p>In favour of the theory of Apollo and Artemis being sun <pb n="137" xml:id="p137"
              />and moon, it is alleged that they were early so considered. Thus we find the Persian
              general of Darius sparing the isle of Delos on their account, and making offerings to
              them evidently as gods of the two great luminaries (Mithras and Mitra in the Persian
                system)<note place="bottom">Herod. vi. 97.</note>. We also meet this view in
                Plato<note place="bottom">Laws, xii. 3.</note> and Euripides<note place="bottom">Fr.
                Phaëthon. 10.</note> ; and in the Alexandrine period it was so prevalent, that
                Callimachus<note place="bottom">Fr. 48.</note> blames those who separate these
              deities from the sun and moon. This however might have been nothing more than the
              arbitrary procedure of priests and philosophers, and more sure grounds must be sought
              in the attributes and epithets of these deities anterior to the time of theocrasy.</p>
            <p>Apollo and Artemis then are brother and sister, the children of Zeus (that is the
              deity) and Leto, whose name, by a perfectly unstrained etymology, may be rendered <hi
                rend="i">Night</hi> ; and the origin of the sun and moon, and their affinity, could
              not be more appropriately described. Apollo is represented as full of manly vigour,
              with long unshorn locks, armed with a golden sword and a bow and quiver, from which he
              sends forth deadly arrows. These waving locks are a simple representation of the beams
              of the sun, who in the Psalms is described as ‘a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
              and rejoicing to run his race ;’ a golden sword is the weapon of Freyr, the sun-god of
              Scandinavian mythology ; and the arrows may well express the penetrating beams of the
              sun, or the <hi rend="i">coups de soleil</hi> and diseases caused by his action. For a
              similar reason arrows were given to the goddess of the moon<note place="bottom"><p>“A
                  man subject to the rays of the moon and the night-damp air, after the burning heat
                  of the day, was almost sure of a fever. The moon, both here (coast of Africa) and
                  in the West Indies, is more powerful than the sun ; meat hung in the rays of the
                  former becomes tainted sooner than if exposed to the latter.” Chamier, Life of a
                  Sailor, i. 270. See Plut. Sympos. iii. 10.</p><p>The Spanish women (we have read)
                  will expose themselves without fear to the rays of the sun, but they cover
                  themselves up against those of the moon.</p></note>. The names Phœbos and Artemis,
              as above explained, agree perfectly with the sun and moon. Apollo being conceived
              armed with bow and arrows, was naturally held to be the god of archery ; and the sun,
              whose eye surveys everything, might <pb n="138" xml:id="p138"/>be looked on as the
              most suitable revealer of the will of Zeus to men, and thence Apollo be the god of
              prophecy. The cheerfulness which the appearance of the sun induces over all nature,
              vivified and refreshed by the repose of the night, and the songs of birds which
              precede or accompany his rising<note place="bottom"><quote><l> ‘Ώ<hi rend="i">ς ἡμὶν

              might easily cause the sun-god to be regarded as the god of music, though it is more
              likely that Apollo owes this character to the employment of the lyre in his worship.
              Artemis may in like manner have been regarded as the goddess of the chase from her
              being armed with arrows, or as the beasts of venery feed by night and sleep by
                day<note place="bottom">“Nemoribus quoque adesse dicitur (Diana) quod omnis venatio
                nocte pascatur dicque dormiat.” Fulgent. ii. 19. Eudocia, 148.</note>, or as the
              moon-goddess was held to preside over the birth and growth of animated beings.
              Finally, the offering of ripe ears of corn, the ‘golden summer’, to Apollo, and his
              being prayed to as the averter of mildew and the destroyer of mice and grasshoppers,
              are reasons for viewing him as a god of nature<note place="bottom">Muller, Dorians, i.
                309.</note>.</p>
            <p>Against all this it is alleged that these identifications were merely the work of the
              philosophers of the Ionic school, who sought to assimilate all the deities of the
              popular creed with material powers or the attributes of the universal intellect ; that
              the epithets and attributes of Apollo all answer to a moral being of great purity,
              while the bow and arrows are a natural symbol of the god who sends death from afar ;
              that nothing can be concluded from his being a patron and protector of agriculture, as
              he is such as the averter of misfortune in general ; that in his religious character
              he is no god of nature, not being a deity of generation and production, but
              represented as ever youthful and unmarried, the tales of his amours being all of a
              late age, and having no connexion with his worship. Finally, great stress is laid on
              the fact of Apollo and Artemis being so totally distinct from the sun and moon in all
              the elder poetry<note place="bottom">Müller, Dorians, <hi rend="i">ut supra.</hi>

              garments, placed a golden wreath on her head, rings of orichalcum and gold in her
              pierced ears, and golden chains about her neck, and then led her to the <pb n="140"
                xml:id="p140"/>assembly of the Immortals, every one of whom admired, saluted, and
              loved her, and each god desired her for his wife.</p>
            <p>Empedocles said that Aphrodite was the daughter of Kronos<note place="bottom">See
                above, p. 69.</note>.</p>
            <p>The husband assigned to this charming goddess is usually the lame artist Hephæstos.
              Her amour with Ares we have already narrated ; and Hermes, Dionysos, and Poseidôn, it
              is said, could also boast of her favours. Among mortals, Anchises and Adonis are those
              whose amours with her are the most famous. The tale of her love-adventure with the
              former is noticed by Homer<note place="bottom">Il. v. 247. 313.</note>, and it is most
              pleasingly told by a Homerid ; the following is an analysis of his hymn.</p>
            <p>Aphrodite had long exercised uncontrolled dominion over the dwellers of Olympos,
              uniting in cruel sport both males and females with mortals. But Zeus resolved that she
              should no longer be exempt from the common lot. Accordingly he infused into her mind
              the desire of a union of love with mortal man. The object selected was Anchises, a
              beautiful youth of the royal house of Troy, who was at that time with the herdsmen
              feeding oxen among the hills and valleys of Ida.</p>
            <p>The moment Aphrodite beheld him she was seized with love. She immediately hastened to
              her temple in Cyprus, where the Graces dressed and adorned her, and then in the full
              consciousness of beauty she proceeded through the air. When she came to Ida, she
              advanced toward the stalls, and was accompanied on her way by all the wild beasts of
              the mountains, whose breasts the exulting goddess filled with love and desire.</p>
            <p>Anchises happened to be alone in the cotes at this time, and was amusing his leisure
              by playing on the lyre. When he beheld the goddess, who had divested herself of the
              usual marks of divinity, he was amazed at her beauty and the splendour of her attire.
              He could not avoid regarding her as something more than human ; he accosts her as one
              of the Immortals, vows an altar to her, and beseeches her to grant him a long and a
              happy life. But Aphrodite denies her <pb n="141" xml:id="p141"/>heavenly origin, and
              feigns that she is a mortal maid and daughter to Otreus king of Phrygia, adding, that
              while she was dancing, in honour of Artemis, with the nymphs and other maidens, and a
              great crowd was standing around, Hermes had snatched her away, and carried her through
              the air over hills and dales and plains, till he had brought her to Ida, where he
              informed her that she was to be the wife of Anchises ; and then, having instructed her
              in what she was to do, had departed, leaving her alone in the mountains. She earnestly
              entreats the Trojan youth to conduct her unsullied to his family, and to dispatch a
              messenger to her father to treat of the marriage and the dower.</p>
            <p>But while thus speaking, the artful goddess filled the heart of the youth with love.
              Believing her now to be mortal, all his veneration vanishes, and he declares that not
              even Apollo should prevent his taking advantage of the favourable moment. He seized
              the hand of the goddess, and ‘led her blushing like the morn’ into the rustic
              shed.</p>
            <p>When evening approached, and the arrival of the herdsmen with the sheep and oxen was
              at hand, the goddess poured a profound sleep over Anchises. She arose from the
              skinstrewn couch, and prepared to depart. Resuming the marks of divinity, the
              brilliant eyes and rosy neck, she stood at the door and called to her slumbering lover
              to awake and observe the change. Filled with awe, he conceals his face in the clothes
              and sues for mercy ; but the goddess reassures him, and informs him that she will bear
              a son, whom she will commit to the mountain-nymphs to rear, and will bring to him when
              in his fifth year. He is then to feign that the child is the offspring of one of the
              nymphs ; but the secret of the goddess is to remain inviolate, under pain of his being
              struck with lightning by Zeus.</p>

                own daughter Smyrna.</note>. When Cinyras found what he had unwittingly done, he
              pursued his daughter with his drawn sword, to efface her crime in her blood. He had
              nearly overtaken her, when she prayed to the gods to make her invisible, and they in
              pity changed her into a myrrh-tree. In ten months afterwards the tree opened, and the
              young Adonis came to light. Aphrodite, delighted with his beauty, put him into a
              coffer, unknown to all the gods, and gave him to Persephone to keep. But as soon as
              she beheld him, the goddess of the under-world refused to part with him ; and the
              matter being referred to Zeus, he decreed that Adonis should have one third of the
              year to himself, be another third with Aphrodite, and the remaining third with

              the regular changes of the seasons, as to feign that the gods themselves were carried
              off or slain ; and he shrewdly observes, that in that case the mournful and the joyful
              parts of the festival should have been held at different times of the year, and not
              joined together as they were. He further inquires, whether the ancient nations, who
              esteemed their gods to be so little superior to men, may not have believed them to
              have been really and not metaphorically put to death. And in truth it is not easy to
              give a satisfactory answer to these questions.</p>
            <p>According to Homer, Aphrodite had an <hi rend="i">embroidered girdle (</hi>κεστὸς
              ἱμὰς), which had the gift of inspiring love and desire for the person who wore it.
              Hera, when about to lull Zeus to sleep by filling him with these affections, borrowed
              the magic girdle from Aphrodite<note place="bottom">Il. xiv. 214.</note>.</p>
            <p>The animals sacred to Aphrodite were swans, doves, and sparrows. Horace<note

              odes ascribed to Anacreon a dove announces herself as a present from the goddess to
              the bard. The bird called Iynx or <hi rend="i">Fritillus</hi>, of which so much use
              was made in amatory magic, was also sacred to this goddess<note place="bottom">See
                Pind. Pyth. iv. 380. and the scholion.</note> ; as was likewise the swallow, the
              herald of spring, the season of love. Her favourite plants were the rose and the
              myrtle. She was chiefly worshiped at Cythera and Cyprus<note place="bottom">The
                goddess of Cyprus was plainly the Phœnician Astarte.</note> ; in which latter isle
              her favourite places were Paphôs, Golgoi, Idalion, and Amathûs ; and also at Cnidos,
              Miletos, Côs, Corinth, Athens, Sparta, etc.</p>
            <p>In the more ancient temples of this goddess in Cyprus she was represented under the
              form of a rude conical stone. But the Grecian sculptors and painters, particularly
              Praxiteles and <pb n="n.p."/>Apelles, vied with each other in forming her image
              the <hi rend="i">ideal</hi> of female beauty and attraction. She appears sometimes
              rising out of the sea and wringing her locks ; sometimes drawn in a conch by Tritons,
              or riding on some marine animal. She is usually naked, or but slightly clad. The Venus

            <p>There is none of the Olympians of whom the foreign origin is so probable as this
              goddess. She is generally regarded as being the same with the Astarte of the
              Phœnicians. There can, we think, be little doubt of the identification of this last
              with the Grecian Aphrodite, for the tale of Adonis sufficiently proves it ; and that
              this took place at a very early period, the name Cypris given to Aphrodite so
              frequently by Homer evinces. Still we look on Aphrodite to be (as her name seems to
                denote<note place="bottom">Ἀ<hi rend="i">ϕροδίτη, quasi Ἀϕροδύτη,
                Foam-sprung.</hi></note>) an originally Grecian deity ; at first, probably, merely
              cosmogonic, but gradually adopted into the system of the Olympians, and endowed with
              some of the attributes of Hera, (who was also identified with Astarte), and thus
              becoming the patroness of marriage<note place="bottom">Il. v. 429.</note>. It was
              probably on account of her being esteemed the same with Astarte, the moon-goddess and
              queen of heaven, that Aphrodite was so frequently styled the <hi rend="i"
                >Heavenly</hi> (Urania). It is very important to observe that she was so named at
              her temple in Cythera, which was regarded as the holiest and most ancient of her fanes
              in Greece. Her antique wooden statue (ξόανον) in this temple was armed, as it also was
              at Sparta and Corinth<note place="bottom">Paus. iii. 23. 1 ; and ii. 5. 1 ; iii. 15.

            <p>The cosmogonic Erôs of Hesiod is apparently a personification of the principle of
              attraction, on which the coherence of the material world depends. Nothing was more
              natural than to term Aphrodite the mother of Love, but the reason for so calling
              Eileithyia, the president of child-birth, is not equally apparent. It may be perhaps
              that in the hymn ascribed to Olên this goddess was identified with Aphrodite Archaia,
              to whom Theseus was said to have dedicated an altar at Delos<note place="bottom"
                >Müller, Dor. i. 333.</note> : possibly it was meant to express the increase of
              conjugal affection produced by the birth of children. The making Love the offspring of
              the West-wind and the Rainbow would seem to be only a poetic mode of expressing the
              wellknown fact, that the spring, the season in which they most prevail, is also that

            <p>The god of love was usually represented as a plump-cheeked boy, rosy and naked, with

            <p>There was a being named Anterôs (ἀντὶ ἔρως), who was in some cases viewed as the
              avenger of slighted love<note place="bottom">Paus. i. 30. 1. Plut. Amat. 20.</note> ;
              in others as the symbol of reciprocal affection<note place="bottom">Plato, Phædr. 255.
                Paus. vi. 23. 4.</note>. The Platonic philosopher Porphyrius tells the following
              pretty legend.</p>
            <p>Aphrodite, complaining to Themis that her son Erôs continued always a child, was told
              by her that the cause was his being solitary, and that if he had a brother he would
              grow apace. Anterôs was soon afterwards born, and Erôs immediately found his wings
              enlarge, and his person and strength greatly increase. But this was only when Anterôs
              was near ; for if he was at a distance, Erôs found himself shrink to his original
              dimensions. The meaning of this fable is so apparent that it needs not
              explication.</p>
            <p>At the time when it was become the mode to exalt the characters of philosophers by
              ascribing to them all kinds of wonderful works, the sophist Eunapius told the
              following curious legend in his life of Jamblichus, the author of as marvellous a life
              of Pythagoras. Jamblichus and his companions having gone to the warm baths of Gadara
              in Lycia, and bathed in them, a conversation arose among them on the nature of the
              baths. The philosopher smiled and said, “Though it is not strictly right in me to do
              so, yet I will show you something new.” He then desired them to inquire of the
              inhabitants, what were the traditional names of two of the smaller but handsomer of
              the warm springs. They replied that one of them was called Erôs and the other Anterôs,
              but that they knew not the cause of their being so styled. Jamblichus, <pb n="148"
                xml:id="p148"/>who was just then standing at the brink of the fount of Erôs, touched
              the water, and murmured a few words over it. Immediately there rose from the bottom a
              little boy of a fair complexion and moderate size : his hair, of a rich golden hue,
              hung down his back, which was bright and clean as that of a person who had just
              bathed. All present were in amazement : the philosopher then leading them to the other
              spring did as he had done before ; and instantly another Love, similar to the first,
              except that his hair was of a bright dark hue, rose to light. The two embraced, and
              clung round the philosopher as if he had been their father ; and after caressing them
              for some time, he restored them to their native element. His companions, who had been
              previously disposed to regard him as an impostor, convinced by this wonder, henceforth
              received his words as those of a divinity.</p>
            <p>The adventures of Erôs are not numerous. Some pretty little trifles respecting him
              will be found in the bucolic poets, and his adventure with Apollo has been already
              noticed. The most celebrated is that contained in the agreeable tale of his love for
              Psyche (ψυχὴ, <hi rend="i">the soul</hi>), preserved by Apuleius in his Metamorphoses,
              and which we will here give in an abridged form.</p>
            <p>There were one time a king and a queen who had three daughters, of whom the youngest
              named Psyche was one of the loveliest creatures earth ever beheld. People crowded from
              all parts to gaze upon her charms, altars were erected to her, and she was worshiped
              as a second Venus. The queen of beauty was irritated on seeing her own altars
              neglected, and her adorers diminishing. She summoned her son ; and conducting him to
              the city where Psyche dwelt, showed him the lovely maid, and ordered him to inspire
              her with a passion for some vile and abject wretch. The goddess departed, leaving her
              son to execute her mandate. Meantime Psyche, though adored by all, was sought as a
              wife by none. Her sisters, who were far inferior to her in charms, were married, and
              she remained single, hating that beauty which all admired.</p>
            <p>Her father consulted the oracle of Apollo, and was ordered <pb n="149" xml:id="p149"
              />to expose her on a rock, whence she would be carried away by a monster, the terror
              of heaven, earth, and hell. The oracle was obeyed, and Psyche amidst the tears of the
              people placed on a lofty rock. Here, while she sat weeping, a zephyr sent for the
              purpose gently raised and carried her to a charming valley. Overcome by grief she
              falls asleep, and on awaking beholds a grove with a fountain in the midst of it, and
              near it a stately palace of most splendid structure. She ventures to enter this
              palace, goes over it lost in admiration at its magnificence ; when suddenly she hears
              a voice, telling her that all there is hers, and all her commands will be obeyed. She
              bathes, sits down to a rich repast, and is regaled with music by invisible performers.
              At night she retires to bed ; an unseen youth addresses her in the softest accents,
              and she becomes his wife.</p>
            <p>Her sisters had meanwhile come to console their parents for the loss of Psyche, whose
              invisible spouse informs her of this event, and warns her of the danger likely to
              arise from it. Moved by the tears of his bride, he however consents that her sisters
              should come to the palace. The obedient zephyr conveys them thither. They grow envious
              of Psyche’s happiness, and try to persuade her that her invisible lord is a serpent,
              who will finally devour her. By their advice she provides herself with a lamp and a
              razor to destroy the monster. When her husband was asleep she arose, took her lamp
              from its place of concealment, and approached the couch ; but there she beheld,
              instead of a dragon, Love himself. Filled with amazement at his beauty, she leaned in
              rapture over his charms : a drop of oil fell from the lamp on the shoulder of the
              god : he awoke, and flew away. Psyche caught his leg as he rose, and was raised into
              the air, but fell ; and as she lay, the god reproached her from a cypress for her
              breach of faith.</p>
            <p>The abandoned Psyche attempted to drown herself in the neighbouring stream ; but,
              fearing Love, it cast her upon a bank of flowers, where she was found and consoled by
              the god Pan. She now goes through the world in search of Cupid : she arrives at the
              kingdom of her sisters ; and, by a false tale of Cupid’s love for them, causes them to
              cast themselves from <pb n="150" xml:id="p150"/>the rock on which she had been
              exposed, and through their credulity they perish. She still roams on, persecuted and
              subjected to numerous trials by Venus. Pitied but unaided by the higher goddesses
              Ceres and Juno, the plants and the animals, the reed, the owl, and the eagle give her
              their advice and assistance. Venus, bent on her destruction, dispatches her to
              Proserpina with a box to request some of her beauty. Psyche, dismayed at the peril of
              the journey to the lower regions, ascends a tower, determined to cast herself from it
              and end her woes ; but the tower pities her, and instructs her how to proceed. She
              accomplishes her mission in safety. As she is returning, she thinks she may venture to
              open the box and take a portion for herself, that she may be the more pleasing to her
              husband. She opens the box, when instead of beauty there issues from it a dense black
              exhalation, and the imprudent Psyche falls to the ground in a deep slumber from its
              effects. In this state she is found by Cupid, who had escaped by the window of the
              chamber where he had been confined by his mother : he awakens her with the point of
              one of his arrows, reproaches her with her curiosity, and then proceeds to the palace
              of Jupiter to interest him in her favour. Jupiter takes pity on her, and endows her
              with immortality : Venus is reconciled, and her marriage with Cupid takes place. The
              Hours shed roses through the sky, the Graces sprinkle the halls of Heaven with
              fragrant odours, Apollo plays on his lyre, the Arcadian god on his reeds, the Muses
              sing in chorus, while Venus dances with grace and elegance to celebrate the nuptials
              of her son. Thus Cupid was at length reunited to his long-lost Psyche, and their loves
              were speedily crowned by the birth of a child, whom his parents named Pleasure<note

            <p>This beautiful fiction is perhaps a philosophic allegory, intended by its inventor
              for a representation of the mystic union between the divine love and the human soul,
              and of the trials and purifications which the latter must undergo, in order to be
              perfectly fitted for an enduring union with the <pb n="151" xml:id="p151"/>divinity.
              It is thus explained by the Christian mythologist Fulgentius<note place="bottom"
                >Mythologicon, iii. 6.</note>. “The city in which Psyche dwells is the world ; the
              king and queen are God and matter ; Psyche is the soul ; her sisters are the flesh and
              the free-will : she is the youngest, because the body is before the mind ; and she is
              the fairest, because the soul is higher than free-will, more noble than the body.
              Venus, i. e. lust, envies her, and sends Cupido, i. e. desire, to destroy her ; but as
              there is desire of good as well as of evil, Cupid falls in love with her : he
              persuades her not to see his face, that is, not to learn the joys of desire ; just as
              Adam, though he could see, did not see that he was naked until he had eaten of the
              tree of desire. At the impulsion of her sisters she put the lamp from under the
              bushel, that is, revealed the flame of desire which was hidden in her bosom, and loved
              it when she saw how delightful it was ; and she is said to have burned it by the
              dripping of the lamp, because all desire burns in proportion as it is loved, and fixes
              its sinful mark on the flesh. She is therefore deprived of desire and her splendid
              fortune, is exposed to perils, and driven out of the palace.”</p>
            <p>This fanciful exposition will probably not prove satisfactory to many readers. The
              following one of a modern writer<note place="bottom">Hirt. <hi rend="i">ap.</hi>
                Creuzer, Symbolik, iii. 573.</note> may seem to come nearer the truth. “This fable,
              it is said, is a representation of the destiny of the human soul. The soul, which is
              of divine origin, is here below subjected to error in its prison the body. Hence
              trials and purifications are set before it, that it may become capable of a higher
              view of things, and of true desire. Two loves meet it, — the earthly, a deceiver who
              draws it down to earthly things ; the heavenly, who directs its view to the original,
              fair and divine, and who gaining the victory over his rival, leads off the soul as his
              bride.”</p>
            <p>According to a third expositor<note place="bottom">Thorlacius, <hi rend="i">ap.</hi>
                cundem, <hi rend="i">ib.</hi></note> the mythe is a moral one. It is intended to
              represent the dangers to which nuptial fidelity was exposed in such a country as
              degenerate Greece, and at the same time to present an image of a fidelity subjected to
              numerous temptations and victorious over them all.</p>
            <pb n="152" xml:id="p152"/><p>The interpretation of an allegory is always hazardous :
              for fancy presided over its birth, and fancy must always have a large share in the
              attempts made to develope its secret and real nature. All, therefore, we should ever
              hope to arrive at is a view of the general sense and meaning. In truth many a tale
              seems to be allegorical which was never meant to be so by its author, and many a tale
                <hi rend="i">is</hi> allegorical in which the vulgar discern nothing but amusing
              narrative. The story of Cupid and Psyche may after all have been, as some think,
              nothing more than a Milesian tale like that of the Matron of Ephesus<note
                place="bottom">See Paldamus, Römische Erotik, p. 92. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.
              We, however, rather incline to the opinion of its having been originally a philosophic
              allegory.</p>
            <p>Ere we quit this subject we must observe, that a Greek name for the <hi rend="i"
                >moth</hi> was Psyche (ψυχ<hi rend="i">ὴ</hi>). The fondness of this insect for
              approaching at night the flame of the lamp or candle, in which it so frequently finds
              its death, reminds a mystic philosopher of the fate of the soul destroyed by the
              desire of knowledge, or absorbed and losing its separate existence in the deity, who
              dwells in light according to the philosophy of the East. But further, the world
              presents no illustration so striking or so beautiful of the immortality of the soul,
              as that of the moth or butterfly bursting on brilliant wings from the dull groveling
              caterpillar-state in which it had previously existed, fluttering in the blaze of day,
              and feeding on the most fragrant and sweetest productions of the spring. Hence it was,
              in all probability, that the Greeks named the butterfly the <hi rend="i"
              >soul.</hi></p>
            <p>The fable of Love and Psyche has been the original of many a pleasing fairy-tale. It
              has been told in French prose by the <hi rend="i">naïf</hi> and charming La Fontaine.
              The united powers of Corneille, Moliere, and Quinault produced a <hi rend="i"
                >tragédie-ballet</hi> named Psyche, for the amusement of the court of Louis XIV. In
              English, the amiable and accomplished Mrs. H. Tighe has narrated the tale of Psyche
              and her celestial lover in elegant and harmonious Spenserian verse.</p>

            <p>The Pallas-Athene of both the Homeric poems is the daughter of Zeus ; in one
                place<note place="bottom">Il. v. 875-80.</note> it seems to be intimated that she
              had no other parent. In the Theogony Zeus swallows Metis, and the ‘blue-eyed
              Tritogeneia’ is born from his head<note place="bottom">Th. 886. <hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi>924. The scholion on v. 890, is as follows :Λέϒεται ὄτι ἡ Μῆτις
                τοιαύτην εἶχε δύναμιν ὤστε μεταβάλλειν εἰς ὁπο<hi rend="i">îαν ἄν</hi> ἐβούλετο.
                Πλανήσας οὖν αὐν. For πικρὰν, which gives little or no sense, Lobeck (Aglaoph.
                p. 613.) would read μυ<hi rend="i">î</hi>αν ; we however prefer μικρἁν, which
                Göttling proposes. This critic points out the similarity between this fiction and
                that of Puss in Boots and the Ogre. See above, p. 80.</note>, which Pindar<note
                place="bottom">Ol. vii. 63. <hi rend="i">seq. cum Schol.</hi></note> says Hephæstos
              opened with a brazen axe ; Athena then sprang forth with a shout which terrified
              Heaven and Mother Earth, while the king of the gods poured a shower of gold on Rhodes,
              the sacred isle of the Sun-god. Stesichorus<note place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. iv.
                1310.</note> had already sung how the goddess issued from the head of her sire in
              perfect panoply, — a circumstance however evidently to be understood in the narrative
              of Pindar. According to the Homerid<note place="bottom">Hom. Hymn xxviii.</note>
              Olympos shook at the divine birth, the earth resounded, the sea was moved, and Helios
              checked his steeds in their career till the new-born goddess took off her radiant
              armour. Later authorities assign the task of opening the head of Zeus to
                Prometheus<note place="bottom">Eur. Iôn 462. Apollod. i. 3.</note>, or Hermes<note
                place="bottom">Sch. Pind. Ol. vii. 66.</note> .</p>
            <pb n="154" xml:id="p154"/><p>Pallas-Athene is in Homer, and in the general popular
              system, the goddess of wisdom and skill. She is in war opposed to Ares, the wild
              war-god, as the patroness and teacher of just and scientific warfare. She is therefore
              on the side of the Greeks, and he on that of the Trojans. But on the shield of
              Achilleus, where the people of the besieged town are represented as going forth to lie
              in ambush, they are led by Ares and Athena together<note place="bottom">Il. xviii.
                516.</note>, possibly to denote the union of skill and courage required for that
                service<note place="bottom">Il. xiii. 277. Od. xiv. 217.</note>. Every prudent chief
              was esteemed to be under the patronage of Athena, and Odysseus was therefore her
              especial favourite, whom she relieved from all his perils, and whose son Telemachos
              she also took under her protection, assuming a human form to be his guide and
              director. In like manner Cadmos, Heracles, Perseus, and other heroes were, as we shall
              see, favoured and aided by this goddess.</p>
            <p>As the patroness of arts and industry in general, Pallas-Athene was regarded as the
              inspirer and teacher of able artists. Thus she taught Epeios to frame the wooden
              horse, by means of which Troy was taken<note place="bottom">Od. viii. 493.</note> ;
              and she also superintended the building of the ship Argo<note place="bottom">See also
                Il. v. 61 ; xv. 412.</note>. Athena was likewise expert in female accomplishments ;
              she wove her own robe and that of Hera, which last she is said to have embroidered
              very richly<note place="bottom">Il. v. 735 ; xiv. 178.</note>. When the hero Iasôn was
              setting forth in quest of the Golden Fleece, Athena gave him a cloak wrought by
                herself<note place="bottom">Apoll. Rh. i. 721.</note>. She taught this art to mortal
              females, who had won her affection<note place="bottom">Od. xx. 72.</note>. When
              Pandora was formed by Hephæstos for the ruin of man, she was attired by
                Pallas-Athene<note place="bottom">Iles. Th. 573.</note>.</p>
            <p>By the Homerid<note place="bottom">Hom. Hymn, xx.</note> Athena and Hephæstos are
              united as the benefactors and civilisers of mankind by means of the arts which they
              taught them, and we shall find them in intimate union in the mythic system of
              Attica.</p>
            <p>Homer<note place="bottom">Il. v. 733.</note> thus describes Pallas-Athene arraying
              herself in the arms of Zeus, when preparing to accompany Hera to the plain where the
              Greeks and Trojans were engaged in conflict.</p>

            <p>A Mæonian maid named Arachne, proud of her skill in weaving and embroidery, in which
              arts the goddess had instructed her, ventured to deny her obligation, and challenged
              her patroness to a trial of skill. Athena, assuming the form of an old woman, warned
              her to desist from her boasting ; and when she found her admonitions were vain, she
              resumed her proper form and accepted the challenge. The skill of Arachne was such, and
              the subject she chose (the love-transformations of the gods) so offensive to Athena,
              that she struck her several times in the forehead with the shuttle. The high-spirited
              maid unable to endure this affront hung herself, and the goddess relenting changed her

                  Nicander. Virgil alludes to it,</p><quote><l>aut invisa Minervæ</l><l>Laxos in

            <p>The invention of the flute or pipe (<hi rend="i">αὐ</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ὸς</hi>) is
              also ascribed to this goddess. When Perseus ; says Pindar<note place="bottom">Pyth.

                  >seq.</hi></note>, had slain Medusa, her two remaining sisters bitterly lamented
              her death. The snakes which formed their ringlets mourned in concert <pb n="156"
                xml:id="p156"/>with them, and Athena hearing the sound was pleased with it, and
              resolved to imitate it : she in consequence invented the pipe, whose music was named
                <hi rend="i">many-headed</hi> (<hi rend="i">πολυκέϕα</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ος</hi>), on
              account of the number of the serpents whose lugubrious hissing had given origin to it.
                Others<note place="bottom">Hyginus, Fab. 165.</note> say the goddess formed the pipe
              from the bone of a stag, and bringing it with her to the banquet of the gods began to
              play on it. Being laughed at by Hera and Aphrodite, on account of her green eyes and
              her swollen cheeks, she went to a fountain on Mount Ida, and played before the liquid
              mirror. Satisfied that the goddesses had had reason for their mirth, she threw her
              pipe away : Marsyas unfortunately found it, and learning to play on it, ventured to
              become the rival of Apollo. His fate has been already related.</p>
            <p>The favourite plant of Athena was the olive, to which she had given origin. Among
              animals the owl and the serpent were sacred to her. Athena was most honoured in
              Athens, the city to which she gave name, where the splendid festivals of the
              Panathenæa were celebrated in her honour. She had also temples at Thebes, Argos,
              Sparta, and elsewhere. At Tegea she was worshiped under the title of Alea. She
              contended, as we have seen, with Poseidôn for Athens and Trœzên, and, according to one
              account, for Argos.</p>
            <p>This goddess is represented with a serious thoughtful countenance, her eyes are large
              and steady, her hair hangs in ringlets on her shoulders, a helmet covers her head ;
              she wears a long tunic and mantle, she bears the ægis on her breast or on her arm, and
              the head of the Gorgon is on its centre. She often has bracelets and ear-rings, but
              her general air is that of a young man in female attire.</p>

            <p>We are now to inquire into the signification of the name of this goddess and her

            <pb n="157" xml:id="p157"/><p>The simplest and most natural interpretation of Pallas
              Athenæe appears to be ‘Athenian Maid,’ and she thus forms a parallel to the

                temple of Athena Koria near Cleitôr in Arcadia. Paus. viii. 21. 4.</note>. As this
              is her constant title in Homer, it is manifest that she had long been regarded as the
              tutelar deity of Athens. We may therefore safely reject the legends of her being the
              same with the Neïth of Saïs in Egypt, or a war-goddess imported from the banks of the
              lake Tritonis in Libya, and view in her one of the deities worshiped by the
              agricultural Pelasgians, and therefore probably one of the powers engaged in causing
              the productiveness of the earth. Her being represented in the poetic creed as the
              goddess of arts and war alone, need not cause us any hesitation, as that transition
              from physical to moral agents, of which we shall presently give an explanation, was by
              no means uncommon.</p>
            <p>The most probable theory, in our opinion, is that which views in Pallas-Athene the
              temperate celestial heat and its principal agent on vegetation, the moon<note

              was a torch-race (λ<hi rend="i">αμπαδοϕορία</hi>) at the Panathenæa, a contest with

                goddess<note place="bottom">Paus. i. 14. 5.</note> ; she was also said to have given
              fire to the Athenians<note place="bottom">Plut. Cim. 10.</note> ; perpetual flame was

              other cause than that of her being regarded as the moon, that the nocturnal owl, whose
              broad full eyes shine so brightly in the dark, was consecrated to her ; the shield or
              corselet with the Gorgon’s head on it seems to represent the full-orbed moon ; and
              finally the epithet <hi rend="i">Glaucopis</hi>, which is as it were appropriated to
              Athena, is also given to Selene<note place="bottom">See above, p. 62. and Appendix,
                C.</note>.</p>
            <p>To these proofs respecting the Athenian goddess we may add that at Tegea Athena was
              called Alea, that is probably <hi rend="i">Warmer.</hi><note place="bottom">Paus.

            <p>If this theory be correct, the best explanation of the perplexing epithet Tritogeneia
              would seem to be that which derives it from the <hi rend="i">three</hi> phases of the
              moon. There are two other interpretations of this name which have had more general
              currency. The one supposes it to signify <hi rend="i">Head-sprung</hi>, as the word
              τριτὼ is said to have signified <hi rend="i">Head</hi> in some of the obscurer
              dialects of Greece<note place="bottom">That of the Athamanes, according to Nicander of
                Colophôn, Hesych. <hi rend="i">s. v.</hi> Etym. Mag. and Photius, <hi rend="i">s.

              very suspicious, and the later Greeks would have made little scruple about coining a
              term if they wanted it to suit any purpose. The other interpretation, which makes the
              banks of the river or lake Tritôn the birth-place of Athena, has found a greater
              number of supporters ; but as so many countries sought to appropriate the Tritôn to
                themselves<note place="bottom">There were Tritons in Bœotia, Thessaly (Sch. Apoll.
                Rh. i. 109.), Arcadia (Paus. viii. 26. 6.), Crete (Diodor. v. 72.), Thrace (Interp.
                to Vib. Sequester, p. 285.).</note>, the choice among them might seem difficult. The
              contest, however, has lain between the river or lake Tritôn in Libya and a small
              stream of the same name in Bœotia. The ancients in general were in favour of the
              former ; but as there is no reason to suppose that the Greeks knew anything of the
              Libyan Tritôn in the days of Homer, or probably till after the colony had been settled
              at Cyrene, this theory seems to have little in its favour. Müller<note place="bottom"
                >Orchom. 355.</note> therefore at once rejects it, and fixes on the banks of the
              Bœotian brook as the natal spot of the <pb n="159" xml:id="p159"/>godless. Here,
              however, again Homer presents a difficulty, for, as we have already observed, the
              practice of assigning birthplaces on earth to the gods does not seem to have prevailed
              in his age. Indeed we strongly suspect that the streamlet that flowed by Alalcomenæ
              got its name in the same manner as the hill Delos at Tegyra, and the grove Ortygia at
                Ephesus<note place="bottom">See below, chap. xv., <hi rend="i">Artemis of
                  Ephesus.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>The moon-goddess of the Athenians probably came by her moral and political character
              in the following manner. It was the practice of the different classes and orders in a
              state to appropriate the general tutelar deity to themselves by some suitable
              appellation. The Attic peasantry, therefore, named Athena the <hi rend="i"
                >Ox-yoker</hi> (Βουδϵία), the citizens called her <hi rend="i">Worker</hi> (Ἐ<hi
                rend="i">ργάνη</hi>), while the military class styled her <hi rend="i"
                >Front-fighter</hi> (П<hi rend="i">ρόμαχος</hi>). As these last were the ruling
              order, their view of the character of the goddess became the prevalent one<note
                place="bottom">See Müller, Min. Pol. p. 1.</note> ; yet even in the epic poetry we
              find the idea of the goddess presiding over the arts still retained.</p>
            <p>Some of the ancients regarded Athena as the air<note place="bottom">Diodor. i. 12.
                Tzetz. Lyc. 519.</note>, others as the earth<note place="bottom">Heraclid. Alleg.

              explained with so much more ease on this last hypothesis, that we think it not
              improbable that the Pelasgian goddess of Argos and other places, who had been
              identified with the Athenian Maid, may have originally been the same with Hera and
                Demeter<note place="bottom">For Athena Hippia and Gorgo, see below, Part II. <hi

              she reminds her how others of the Celestials had suffered similar calamities inflicted
              by <pb n="160" xml:id="p160"/>mortals. Thus Ares, she says, was once shut up in a
              brazen prison by Otos and Ephialtes, where he languished till Hermeias, being informed
              of his state, contrived to steal him out of his dungeon. Elsewhere the poet tells us
              that of all the Trojans Hermeias most loved Phorbas (<hi rend="i">Feeder</hi>), <hi

              ).</p>
            <p>Hermeias is opposed in the battle of the gods to Leto, but declines the combat on the
              plea of the impolicy of making an enemy of one of the consorts of Zeus ; at the same

              When the corse of Hectôr was exposed by Achilleus, the gods, pitying the fate of the
              hero, urged Hermeias to <hi rend="i">steal</hi> it away. On king Priamos’ setting
              forth to ransom the body of his son, Zeus desires Hermeias to accompany him, reminding
              him of his fondness for associating with mankind<note place="bottom">Il. xxiv.
                333.</note>. The god obeys his sire, puts on his ‘immortal golden sandals, which
              bear him over the water and the extensive earth like the blasts of the wind,’ and
              takes ‘his rod, with which he lays asleep the eyes of what men he will, and wakes
              again the sleepers.’ He accompanies the aged monarch in the form of a Grecian youth,

              explicitly as the deity presiding over flocks and herds, saying that the herdsmen
              prayed to him and Hecate. This poet also ascribes to him the only act injurious to man
              with which he is charged, namely, a share in the formation of the fatal Pandora, to
              whom he gave her ‘currish mind and artful disposition<note place="bottom">Works and
                Days, 67.</note>.’</p>
            <p>One of the last of the Homerids thus sang the story of the birth and first exploits
              of this sly deity.</p>
            <p>Hermes was born of the mountain-nymph Maia, in a cavern of Mount Cyllene in Arcadia.
              He had scarcely been laid in his cradle, when he got up and set off for Pieria to
              steal cows from Apollo. As he was going out he met a tortoise, which he caught up and
              carried back into the cave ; where quick as thought he killed the animal, took out the
              flesh, adapted reeds and strings to the shell, and formed from it the phorminx or
              lyre, on which he immediately played with perfect skill. He then laid it up in his
              cradle, and resumed his journey.</p>
            <p>He arrived by sunset in Pieria, where the oxen of the gods fed under the care of
              Apollo. He forthwith separated fifty cows from the herd and drove them away,
              contriving to make them go backwards ; and throwing away his sandals, bound branches
              of myrtle and tamarisk under his feet, that the herdsman-god might have no clue by
              which to trace his cattle. As he passed by Onchestos in Bœotia, he saw an old man
              engaged in planting his vineyard, whom he straitly charged not to tell what he had
              seen. He then pursued his way by ‘shady hills, resounding vales, and flowery plains,’
              and as the moon was rising arrived with his booty on the banks of the Alpheios in the
              Peloponnese. He there fed and stalled the kine, made a fire, killed, cut up, and
              dressed two of them, and even made black-puddings of their blood, and then thriftily
              spread their skins to dry on a rock. He burned the heads and feet, and put out the
              fire, effacing all signs of it, and flung his twig-sandals into the river. With
              day-break <pb n="162" xml:id="p162"/>he slunk home and stole into his cradle, not
              unobserved by his mother, who reproached him with his deeds ; but he replied, that he
              was resolved by his actions to procure admission for her and himself to the assembly
              of the gods.</p>
            <p>In the morning Apollo missed his kine : he set out in search of them, met the old
              man, who informed him of his having seen a child driving cows along. He comes to
              Pylos, where he sees the traces of his cattle, but is amazed at the strange footprints
              of their driver. He proceeds to the fragrant cave of the nymph, and Hermes on seeing
              him gathers himself up under the clothes, afraid of the god. Apollo takes the key,
              opens and searches the three closets where the nymph kept her clothes, ornaments, and
              food, but to no purpose. He then threatens the child that he will fling him into
              Tartaros unless he tells him where the cows are : but Hermes stoutly denies all
              knowledge of them, and even very innocently asks what cows are. Apollo pulls him out
              of his cradle, and they agree to go and argue the matter before Zeus. Arrived in
              Olympos, Apollo relates the theft, and tells what reasons he had for suspecting the
              baby of being the thief. All this is, to the great amusement of the Celestials,
              manfully denied and its absurdity shown by the little fellow, who still has his
              cradle-clothes about him. Zeus however gives it against him, and the two brothers are
              sent in quest of the missing kine. They come to Pylos, and Hermes drives the cattle
              out of the cave : Apollo misses two of them ; to his amazement he sees their skins
              upon the rock, and is still more surprised, when, on going to drive the others on, he
              finds that the art of Hermes had rooted their feet to the ground. Hermes then begins
              to play on his lyre, the tones of which so ravish Apollo that he offers him the cows
              for it. The young god gives him the lyre, and receives the cattle. The divine herdsman
              also bestows on him his whip, and instructs him in the management of the herds.</p>
            <p>They now proceed together to Olympos, where Apollo still suspicious exacts an oath
              from Hermes that he will never steal his lyre or bow ; and this being complied with,
              he presents him with ‘a golden, three-leafed, innocuous rod’ the giver of wealth and
              riches.</p>
            <pb n="163" xml:id="p163"/><p>The stealing of the cattle of Apollo is somewhat

              Thessalian youth, neglected the care of his oxen, which pastured along with those of
              Admetos. Hermes, who in this version of the legend is not a babe, thought the
              opportunity favourable for stealing a few of the heedless herdsman’s cattle. He first
              cast the dogs into a deep slumber, and then drove off twelve heifers, a hundred
              unyoked cows, and a bull. He took the precaution of tying a bundle of twigs to the
              tail of each to efface their footprints, and brought his prize safely on to the place
              called the Look-out of Battos, in the Peloponnese. Hearing the lowing of the kine,
              Battos ran out to look, and immediately knew them to be stolen, but agreed for a
              certain reward not to give information to any one respecting them. Hermes having
              arranged this matter drove on, and concealed his stolen kine in a cavern. He then
              resolved to make trial of the fidelity of Battos, and, changing his form, came and
              inquired if he had seen any one driving stolen cattle by, offering a cloak as a reward
              for intelligence. The covetous Battos took the cloak, and turned informer : the god,
              incensed at his duplicity, struck him with his rod and changed him into a rock, ‘which
              the cold or the heat never leaves.’</p>
            <p>The following prank is also laid to the charge of this sly deity. Watching one day
              his mother and her sisters when they went to bathe, he stole their clothes, and did
              not return them till he had amused himself well with laughing at their perplexity<note

            <p>A god with so many agreeable qualities as Hermes was not very likely to fail of
              success with the fair sex, both among gods and mankind. Homer, as we have observed
              above, says that Eudoros, one of Achilleus’ captains, was the son of Hermes by
              Polymela the daughter of Phylas. The god having seen <pb n="164" xml:id="p164"/>her,
              singing in the choir of Artemis, had fallen in love with her. She bore him privately a
              son, who was reared by her father, herself having married Echecles. By Chione the
              daughter of Dædaliôn<note place="bottom">Pherecyd. <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch. Od. xix.

            <p>One day Hermes beheld Herse, the daughter of Cecrops, among the maidens who were
              carrying the sacred baskets to the temple of Pallas-Athene. Smitten with her charms,
              he entered the royal abode, where the three sisters, Aglauros, Pandrosos and Herse,
              occupied three separate chambers. That of Herse was in the middle, that of Aglauros on
              the left. The latter first saw the god, and inquired of him who he was and why he
              came. Hermes immediately informed her of his rank, and his love for her sister,
              entreating her good offices in his suit. These she promised on the condition of
              receiving a large quantity of gold, and drove him out of the house till he should have
              given it. Pallas-Athene incensed at her unhallowed cupidity, and provoked with her
              also for other causes, sent Envy to fill her bosom with that baleful passion. Unable
              then to endure the idea of the felicity of her sister, she sat down at the door,
              determined not to permit the god to enter. Hermes exerted his eloquence and his
              blandishments on her in vain ; at length, provoked by her obstinacy, he turned her
              into a black stone. Herse became the mother of Cephalos<note place="bottom">Ovid, Met.

            <p>The only amour of Hermes with any of the dwellers of Olympos was that with Aphrodite,
              of which the offspring was a son named Hermaphroditos, from the names of his parents,
                <pb n="165" xml:id="p165"/>and whose adventure with the Naïs Salmacis is narrated by
              Ovid in his Metamorphoses<note place="bottom">Met. iv. 285.</note>. Hermes is in some

            <p>At Tanagra in Bœotia Hermes was worshiped under the names of <hi rend="i"

              delivered the citizens from a pestilence, by carrying a ram round the walls ; and on
              the festival of Hermes, the most beautiful of the Tanagrian youths bore a lamb on his
              shoulders round the walls in honour of the god. The latter title was conferred on him
              because, when the Eretrians attacked the Tanagrians, Hermes as a young man, and armed
              with a currycomb, led the latter to victory<note place="bottom">Pausan. ix. 22. These
                are both silly expositions ; the first is confuted by the fact that in the Carnasian
                grove in Messene there was a statue of Hermes carrying a ram (Paus. iv. 33, 4.), and
                a similar statue at Olympia (<hi rend="i">Id.</hi> v. 27,8.). At Corinth there was a

            <p>Hermes was regarded as the god of commerce, of wrestling and all the exercises of the
              palæstra, of eloquence, even of thieving ; in short, of everything relating to gain or
              requiring art and ingenuity. A certain good-humoured roguery was at all times a trait
              in his character. In the pleasing tale of Ares and Aphrodite already noticed, the
              gallant reply of Hermes to the question of Phœbos-Apollo called forth the laughter of
              the Olympians.</p>
            <p>This god is usually represented with a <hi rend="i">chlamys</hi> or cloak neatly
              arranged on his person, with his <hi rend="i">petasus</hi> or winged hat, and the <hi

              and which sometimes has wings at its extremity. The ancient statues of Hermes were
              nothing more than wooden posts with a rude head and a pointed beard carved on them.
              They were what is termed <hi rend="i">ithyphallic</hi>, and were set up on the roads
              and <pb n="166" xml:id="p166"/>footpaths, and in the fields and gardens. The Hermæ
              were also pillars of stone, and the head of some other deity at times took the place
              of that of Hermes ; such were the Hermeracles, Hermathenæ and others. One of these
              compounds may have given origin to the tale of Hermaphroditos.</p>

            <p>Mythologists are pretty generally agreed in recognizing in the Hermes of the original
              Pelasgian system a telluric power. The simplest derivation of his name is from <hi
                rend="i">ἔρα, the earth</hi> ; and he is, we may observe, the son of Zeus and Maia,
              probably Mother Earth<note place="bottom">Ͳ<hi rend="i">ιρ</hi> Μ<hi rend="i">αίας
                ἀγροτ</hi>ῆ<hi rend="i">ρι κούριρ</hi> — Eurip. Elec. 466.</note>. He
              seems to have been the deity of productiveness in general, but he came gradually to be
              regarded as presiding more particularly over flocks and herds<note place="bottom"
                >Hence he was called <hi rend="i">νόμιος</hi> (Aristoph. Thes. 977. <hi rend="i"
                  >ἔϕορος γὰρ τῶν θρεμμάτων ὸ θεὸς</hi> says the Scholiast) ; and he was worshiped
                at Coroneia under the title of <hi rend="i">ἐπιμήλιο</hi> (Paus. ix. 31,
              3.).</note>. From this last view some of his Hellenic attributes may be simply
              deduced. Thus the god of shepherds was naturally regarded as the inventor of music ;
              the lyre is ascribed to Hermes as the pipes are to his son Pan, music having been
              always a recreation of the shepherds in the warm regions of the south. In like manner
              as the shepherd-lads amuse themselves with wrestling and other feats of strength and
              activity, their tutelar god easily became the president of the <hi rend="i"
                >palæstra.</hi>
              <pb n="167" xml:id="p167"/>So also, trade having of old consisted chiefly in the
              exchange of cattle, Hermes, the herdsman’s god, was held to be the god of
                commerce<note place="bottom">This is the only point of similarity between the
                Grecian Hermes and the Italian Mercurius.</note> ; and the skill and eloquence
              employed in commercial dealings made him to be the god of eloquence, artifice, and
              ingenuity, and even of cheating<note place="bottom">Hence probably his epithet <hi

                  >στροϕὴ</hi>) of the door on its hinges, as his statue was placed at the
                door.</note>. For this cause, among others, it may have been that godsends or
              treasure-trove were ascribed to him<note place="bottom">What was thus found was called
                  <hi rend="i">ἕρμαιον</hi>. When Lucian’s Timôn comes on the treasure he cries out

            <p>The rural deity, when thus become active, sly, and eloquent, was well adapted for the
              office which was assigned him of agent and messenger of the king of the gods, to whom
              we also find him officiating as cup-bearer<note place="bottom">See above,
                p. 111.</note>. As a being whose operations extended into the interior of the earth,
              Hermes would seem to have been in some points of view identified with Hades. In
                Pindar<note place="bottom">Ol. ix. 50. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Sec above,
                p. 94.</note> this latter deity himself performs the office generally assigned to
              Hermes, that of conducting the departed to Erebos. Possibly it may have been on this
              account that Solôn directed the Athenians to swear by Zeus, Poseidôn, and Hermes.</p>
            <p>On looking over the adventures of Hermes above related, it will appear that most of
              them refer to his character as a rural deity<note place="bottom">Müller,
                Proleg. 355.</note>. Such are his patronage of Phorbas, and his being the sire of
              Eudoros in Homer ; the hymn in his honour, which plainly represents him as a rural
                deity<note place="bottom">See vv. 491, 567.</note> ; his being the sire of <pb

              Chione (<hi rend="i">Snow</hi>) ; of the two heroes ‘rich in corn-fields’ ; and of the
              shepherd Daphnis, and the gods Pan and Priapos. The rural character of Herse and
              Aglauros will be shown in the sequel. We shall also find that it was Hermes who gave
              to Nephele the gold-fleeced ram to save her children from their malignant
                step-mother<note place="bottom">By his touch, it was said, he turned the fleece to
                gold. Sch. Apoll. Rh. ii. 1144.</note>. In the poems of the Greek Anthology Hermes
              is usually represented as a rural deity. In one place<note place="bottom">Anthol. ix.
                72.</note> the offering to him is milk and honey ; in other parts of it<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> vi. 5, 23, 28, 29.</note> fishermen when grown
              old dedicate their implements to Hermes, either as the god of arts and trade, or as
              the deity presiding over increase in general.</p>
            <p>We will now consider the well-known epithet Argeiphontes, or <hi rend="i"
                >Argos-slayer</hi>, given to this god. The general opinion derives it from the
              legend of Io, but it has been doubted if that adventure was known to Homer, who calls
              the deity by this name in passages the genuineness of which cannot well be
                disputed<note place="bottom">Il. ii. 103. Od. i. 38.</note>. The sense of that
              legend shall be discussed in its proper place ; here we will only observe, that if it
              should appear to be as old as the age of Homer, there can be no further dispute about
              the origin of the epithet, though its meaning will still remain a subject of inquiry.
              Supposing however such not to be the case, it may be asked how the rural deity, the
              field-god, came by the appellation Argeiphontes ? The word <hi rend="i">Argos</hi>
              bears in Greek the following senses : 1. <hi rend="i">White</hi> or <hi rend="i"
                >Shining</hi> ; 2. <hi rend="i">Swift</hi>(in speaking of dogs, and thence the name
              of a dog) ; 3. <hi rend="i">Idle</hi> ; to which we may venture to add, 4. <hi
                rend="i">Land</hi>, as identical with <hi rend="i">ἄγρος</hi>. The latter half of
              the compound was generally derived from <hi rend="i">ϕένω, to kill</hi> or <hi
                rend="i">destroy</hi> ; by some however from <hi rend="i">ϕαίνω</hi>, to <hi
                rend="i">show</hi> or <hi rend="i">shine.</hi> Hence some interpreted Argeiphontes
                <hi rend="i">Free-from-bloodshed</hi>, others <hi rend="i">White</hi>- or <hi

            <p>The most celebrated event in the history of Demeter is the carrying off of her
              daughter Persephone by Hades, and the search of the goddess after her through the
              world. It is noticed by Hesiod<note place="bottom">Theog. 914.</note> ; but the
              Homeridian hymn in her honour contains perhaps the earliest narrative of this event,
              which, though apparently unknown to Homer, became a favourite theme with succeeding

            <p rend="noindent">Unconscious of danger the maiden stretched forth her hand to seize
              the wondrous flower, when suddenly the wide earth gaped, Aïdoneus in his golden
              chariot rose, and catching the terrified goddess carried her off in it shrieking to
              her father for aid, unheard and unseen by gods or mortals, save only by Hecate the
              daughter of Persæos, who heard her as she sat in her cave, and by king Helios, whose
              eye nothing on earth escapes.</p>
            <p>So long as the goddess beheld the earth and starry heaven, the fishy sea and beams of
              the sun, so long she hoped to see her mother and the tribes of the gods ; and the tops
              of the mountains and the depths of the sea resounded with her divine voice. At length
              her mother heard ; she tore her head-attire with grief, cast a dark robe around her,
              and like a bird hurried ‘over moist and dry.’ Of all she inquired tidings of her lost
              daughter, but neither gods nor men nor birds could give her intelligence. Nine days
              she wandered over the earth, with flaming torches in her hands, she tasted not of
              nectar or ambrosia, and never once entered the bath. On the tenth morning Hecate met
              her, but she could not tell her who it was had carried away Persephone. Together they
              proceed to Helios ; they stand at the head of his horses, and Demeter entreats that he
              will say who the ravisher is. The god of the sun gives the required information,
              telling her that it was Aïdoneus, who by the permission of her sire had carried her
                <pb n="172" xml:id="p172"/>away to be his queen ; and he exhorts the goddess to
              patience, by dwelling on the rank and dignity of the ravisher.</p>
            <p>Helios urged on his steeds ; the goddess, incensed at the conduct of Zeus, abandoned
              the society of the gods, and came down among men. But she now was heedless of her
              person, and no one recognised her. Under the guise of an old woman, — ‘such,’ says the
              poet, ‘as are the nurses of law-dispensing kings’ children, and housekeepers in
              resounding houses,’ — she came to Eleusis, and sat down by a well, beneath the shade
              of an olive<note place="bottom">The tradition was that she sat on the stone thence
                named Laughterless (ἀγέλασ<hi rend="i">τος</hi>). Sch. Aristoph. Knights,
                782.</note>. The three beautiful daughters of Keleos, a prince of that place, coming
              to the well to draw water, and seeing the goddess, inquired who she was and why she
              did not go into the town. Demeter told them her name was Dôs, and that she had been
              carried off by pirates from Crete, but that when they got on shore at Thoricos, she
              had contrived to make her escape, and had wandered thither. She entreats them to tell
              her where she is ; and wishing them young husbands and as many children as they may
              desire, begs that they will endeavour to procure her a service in a respectable
              family.</p>
            <p>The princess Callidice tells the goddess the names of the five princes, who with her
              father governed Eleusis, each of whose wives would, she was sure, be most happy to
              receive into her family a person who looked so god-like : but she prays her not to be
              precipitate, but to wait till she had consulted her mother Metaneira, who had a young
              son in the cradle, of whom if the stranger could obtain the nursing her fortune would
              be made.</p>
            <p>The goddess bowed her thanks, and the princesses took up their pitchers and went
              home. As soon as they had related their adventure to their mother, she agreed to hire
              the nurse at large wages :</p>

            <p rend="noindent"><pb n="173" xml:id="p173"/>The goddess rose and accompanied them
              home. As she entered the house a divine splendour shone all around ; Metaneira filled
              with awe offered the goddess her own seat, which however she declined. Iambe the
              serving-maid then prepared one for her, where she sat in silence, thinking of her
              ‘deep-bosomed’ daughter, till Iambe by her tricks contrived to make her smile, and
              even laugh. But she declined the cup of wine which Metaneira offered her, and would
              only drink the <hi rend="i">kykeôn</hi>, or mixture of flour and water. She undertook
              the rearing of the babe, who was named Demophoôn, and beneath her care ‘he throve like
              a god.’ He ate no food, but Demeter breathed on him as he lay in her bosom, and
              anointed him with ambrosia, and every night she hid him ‘like a torch within the
              strength of fire,’ unknown to his parents, who marvelled at his growth<note

            <p>It was the design of Demeter to make him immortal, but the curiosity and folly of
              Metaneira deprived him of the intended gift. She watched one night, and, seeing what
              the nurse was about, shrieked with affright and horror. The goddess threw the infant
              on the ground, declaring what he had lost by the inconsiderateness of his mother, but
              announcing that he would be great and honoured, since he had ‘sat in her lap and slept
              in her arms.’ She tells who she is, and directs that the people of Eleusis should
              raise an altar and temple to her without the town on the hill Callichoros.</p>

              Keleos, who laid the matter before the people, and the temple was speedily raised. The
              mourning goddess took up her abode in it, but a dismal year came upon mankind ; the
              earth yielded no produce, in vain the oxen drew the curved ploughs in the fields, in
              vain was the seed of barley cast into the ground ; ‘well-garlanded Demeter’ would
              suffer no increase. The whole race of man ran risk of perishing, the dwellers of
              Olympos of losing gifts and sacrifices, had not Zeus discerned the danger and thought
              on a remedy.</p>
            <p>He dispatches ‘gold-winged Iris’ to Eleusis to invite Demeter back to Olympos, but
              the disconsolate goddess will not comply with the call. All the other gods are sent on
              the same errand, and to as little purpose. Gifts and honours are proffered in vain ;
              she will not ascend to Olympos, or suffer the earth to bring forth, till she shall
              have seen her daughter.</p>
            <p>Finding that there was no other remedy, Zeus sends ‘goldrodded Argos-slayer’ to
              Erebos, to endeavour to prevail on Hades to suffer Persephone to return to the light.
              Hermes did not disobey : he quickly reached the ‘secret places of earth,’ and found
              the king at home seated on a couch with his wife, who was mourning for her mother. On
              making known to Aïdoneus the wish of Zeus, ‘the king of the Subterraneans smiled with
              his brows’ and yielded compliance. He kindly addressed Persephone, granting her
              permission to return to her mother. The goddess instantly sprang up with joy, and
              heedlessly swallowed a grain of pomegranate which he presented to her.</p>

              versions of it given by the above-mentioned Latin poets, the scene is transferred to
              the grove and lake in the neighbourhood of Henna in Sicily, the nymph Arethusa gives
              intelligence of the ravisher, and Ascalaphos (who for his mischief-making is turned

              tells of Persephone having plucked a pomegranate in the garden of Hades and put seven
              of the seeds into her mouth. In this, as in other legends, the fancy of poets and
              vanity of the inhabitants of different places have taken abundance of liberties with
              the ancient tale.</p>
            <p>There are, as we have already observed, no traces of this legend in Homer. Demeter is
              only incidentally mentioned by him ; and he does not intimate any connexion between
              her and Persephone, who appears merely as the daughter of Zeus<note place="bottom">Od.
                xi. 217.</note> and queen of Hades. There can be little doubt we think of its being
              an allegory. Persephone signifies the seed-corn, which when cast into the ground lies
              there concealed, — that is, she is carried off by the god of the under-world : it
              reappears, — that is, Persephone is restored to her mother, and she abides with her
              two-thirds of the year. As however the seed-corn is not a third part of the year in
              the ground, it is probable that by the space of time which Persephone was to spend
              with the god in the invisible state, was intended to be expressed the period between
              the sowing of the seed and the appearance of the ear, during which the corn is away ;
              and which space of time in some species of grain, barley for instance, is about four
              months.</p>
            <p>The vanity of the people of the hungry soil of Attica made them pretend that corn was
              first known and agriculture first practised in their country. They fabled that the

            <p>At Onceion near Thelpusa, on the banks of the Ladôn in Arcadia, stood a temple of
              Demeter-Erinnys. The legend connected with it was as follows<note place="bottom">Paus.
                viii. 25, 4.</note>. When the goddess was in search of her lost daughter, Poseidôn,
              filled with desire, <pb n="178" xml:id="p178"/>continually followed her. To elude him
              she changed herself into a mare, and mingled with the mares of Oncos ; but the seagod
              assumed the form of a horse, and thus accomplished his wishes. The produce of their
              union was the celebrated steed Areiôn ; and from the anger of the goddess at being
              thus abused she was named Erinnys<note place="bottom">Ὃ<hi rend="i">τι τὸ

              of the tradition that beside Areiôn she bore a daughter to the god, who, the
              Phigalians said, was the Despœna (Persephone). They also showed a cavern on Mount
              Elæon, to which Demeter retired when her daughter had been carried off, clothing
              herself in deep black. The absence of the goddess, said the tradition, caused a
              general failure of the crops, and mankind were in danger of famine ; but no one knew
              the place of her retreat till Pan in his huntings chanced to see her. He gave
              information to Zeus, who sent the Fates to her, at whose persuasion she remitted her
              anger, and ceased from mourning. She was worshiped at this cave under the name of <hi

            <p>This last legend has nothing perhaps very peculiar in it ; the former is regarded as

            <p>The form of Demeter is copied from that of Hera. She has the same majestic stature
              and matronly air, but of a milder character. Her usual symbol are poppies, which
              sometimes compose a garland for her head, sometimes are held in her hand. She is
              frequently represented with a torch in her hand, — significant of her search after

            <p>The name of Demeter offers, as we have seen, no difficulty whatever ; but that of her
              daughter is by no means so easy of explanation ; and here, as in similar cases, the
              question is, what was the original conception of this goddess ? Was she simply
              regarded as the queen of the monarch of Erebos, or as the daughter of Mother Earth,
              and a personification of the corn ? In the latter case critics consider her name to
              signify <hi rend="i">Food-shower</hi><note place="bottom">Völcker, Myth. der Jap.
                p. 201, 202. Welcker in Schwenk, 299. These critics derive the name from <hi

                Schwenk (247.) renders it <hi rend="i">Lighting</hi>, regarding, as we think justly,
                the first part of the name as akin to <hi rend="i">πȗρ</hi>, and to the <hi rend="i"
                  >Pers</hi> in Perse, Perseus. See below, <hi rend="i">Perseus.</hi></note> ; in
              the former it might mean <hi rend="i">Light-destroyer</hi>, a name corresponding well
              with Aïdes and Erebos<note place="bottom">It is commonly rendered <hi rend="i"
                  >Death-bearer</hi>, from <hi rend="i">ϕέρω ϕόνον.</hi> The Persephatta of the
                dramatists seems to be only a corruption of Persephone.</note>.</p>
            <p>We have ventured to offer this conjecture concerning the origin of the name
              Persephone, because we think critics have gone into an extreme respecting the
              religious opinions of the ancient Pelasgians. For as there appears reason to suppose
              their religion to have been of a very rural character, the view generally taken is
              that they were, like our modern political œconomists, a race who thought only of
              production and consumption, and regarded no deities but such as were promoters of
              increase. We however deem that, like every other people, the Pelasgians believed in a
              future state, and worshiped a deity presiding over that unseen world. It may be
              doubted whether they gave him a consort (for in the Italian system such was not the
              case), but the probability is that the Achæans derived that principle of their
              religion from their Pelasgian forefathers. In such case the spouse of the invisible
              god might very naturally be termed the <hi rend="i">Light-destroyer.</hi> The epithets
              of Persephone certainly accord far better with an original queen of Erebos than with
              the gentle innocent daughter of Demeter.</p>
            <pb n="181" xml:id="p181"/><p>We cannot take our leave of Demeter and the Kora<note

                <hi rend="i">mysteries</hi> of Eleusis, in which they were the great objects of
              adoration. But instead of going into all the mysticism which has been written
              respecting them, both in ancient and modern times, we will content ourselves with
              giving some of the results of the inquiries of the learned and judicious Lobeck,
              referring those anxious for fuller information to his valuable work entitled
              Aglaophamus.</p>
            <p>In the very early ages of Greece and Italy, and probably of most countries, the
              inhabitants of the various independent districts into which they were divided had very
              little communication with each other, and a stranger was regarded as little better
              than an enemy. Each state had its own favourite deities, under whose especial
              protection it was held to be, and these deities were propitiated by sacrifices and
              ceremonies, which were different in different places. It is further to be recollected,
              that the Greeks believed their gods to be very little superior in moral qualities to
              themselves, and they feared that if promises of more splendid and abundant sacrifices
              and offerings were made to them, their virtue might not be adequate to resisting the
              temptation. As the best mode of escaping the calamity of being deserted by their
              patrons, they adopted the expedient of concealing their names, and of excluding
              strangers from their worship. Private families in like manner excluded their
              fellow-citizens from their family-sacrifices ; and in those states where ancient
              statues, aërolites, and such like were preserved as national palladia, the sight of
              them was restricted to the magistrates and principal persons in the state<note
                place="bottom">Aglaoph. 65. 273, 274.</note>.</p>
            <p>We are to recollect that Eleusis and Athens were long independent of each other<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> 214. 1351. Muller, Dor. i. 201.</note>. The
              worship of Demeter and the Kora was the national and secret religion of the
              Eleusinians, from which the Athenians were of course excluded as well as all other
              Greeks. But when Eleusis was conquered, and the two states coalesced, the Athenians
              became participators in <pb n="182" xml:id="p182"/>the worship of these deities ;
              which however remained so long confined to them as to have given origin to a proverb
                (Ἀ<hi rend="i">ττικοὶ τὰ Ἐλευίνια</hi>) applied to those who met together in secret
              for the performance of any matter<note place="bottom">Aglaoph. 271.</note>. Gradually,
              with the advance of knowledge and the decline of superstition and national
              illiberality, admission to witness the solemn rites celebrated each year at Eleusis
              was extended to all Greeks of either sex and of every rank, provided they came at the
              proper time, had committed no inexpiable offence, had performed the requisite previous
              ceremonies, and were introduced by an Athenian citizen<note place="bottom"><hi
                  rend="i">Id.</hi> 14. 28. 31.</note>.</p>
            <p>These mysteries, as they were termed, were performed with a considerable degree of
              splendour, at the charge of the state and under the superintendence of the
              magistrates ; whence it follows as a necessary consequence, that the rites could have
              contained nothing that was grossly immoral or indecent<note place="bottom"><hi
                  rend="i">Id.</hi> 116.</note>. There does not appear to be any valid reason for
              supposing, as many do, that a public discourse on the origin of things and that of the
              gods, and other high and important matters, was delivered by the Hierophant, or person
              who bore the highest office in the mysteries ; whose name would rather seem to be
              derived from his <hi rend="i">exhibiting the sacred things</hi>, — ancient statues,
              probably of the goddesses, — which were kept carefully covered up, and only shown on
              these solemn occasions. The delivering of a public discourse would in fact have been
              quite repugnant to the usages of the Greeks in their worship of the gods, and the
              evidence offered in support of this supposition is extremely feeble. But the singing
              of sacred hymns in honour of the goddess always formed a part of the service<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> 63. 193. Müller, Proleg. 250. 251.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ancient writers are full of the praises of the Eleusinian mysteries, of the
              advantage of being <hi rend="i">initiated</hi>, i. e. admitted to participate in them,
              and of the favour of the gods in life, and the cheerful hopes in death, which were the
              consequence of it. Hence occasion has been taken to assert, that a system of religion
              little inferior to pure Christianity was taught in them. But these hopes, and this
              tranquillity of mind and <pb n="183" xml:id="p183"/>favour of Heaven, are easy to be
              accounted for without having recourse to so absurd a supposition. Every act performed
              in obedience to the will of Heaven is believed to draw down its favour on the
              performer. The Mussulman makes his pilgrimage to the Kaaba at Mecca, the Catholic to
              Loretto, Compostella, or elsewhere ; and each is persuaded that by having done so he
              has secured the divine favour<note place="bottom">Aglaoph. 70. 71.</note>. So the
              Greek who was initiated at Eleusis, — whose mysteries, owing to the fame in which
              Athens stood, the able writers who so loudly extolled her and everything belonging to
              her, the splendour and magnificence with which they were performed, eclipsed all
              others, — retained ever after a lively sense of the happiness which he had enjoyed
              when admitted to view the interior of the illuminated temple, and the sacred things
              which it contained, when to his excited imagination the very gods themselves had
              seemed visibly to descend from their Olympian abodes, amidst the solemn hymns of the
              officiating priests<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> 44. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi> 63. See Mortimer’s description of the effect of the solemn service in
                St. Peter’s at Rome on his mind, in Schiller’s Marie Stuart, act i. sc. 6. Sec also
                Shakspcare's Winter's Tale, act iii. sc. 1.</note>. Hence there naturally arose a
              persuasion, that the benign regards of the gods were bent upon him through
              after-life ; and, as man can never divest himself of the belief of his continued
              existence after death, a vivid hope of enjoying bliss in the next life.</p>
            <p>It was evidently the principle already stated, of seeking to discover the causes of
              remarkable appearances, which gave origin to most of the ideas respecting the
              recondite sense of the actions and ceremonies which took place in the Eleusinian
              mysteries. The stranger, dazzled and awed by his own conception of the sacredness and
              importance of all that he beheld, conceived that nothing there could be without some
              mysterious meaning. What this might be, he inquired of the officiating ministers, who,
              as various passages in Herodotus and Pausanias show, were seldom without a legend or
                <hi rend="i">Sacred Account</hi> (<hi rend="i">ἱεργος λόγος</hi>), as it was called,
              to explain the dress or ceremony, which owed perhaps its true origin to the caprice or
              sportive humour of a ruder period. Or if the initiated <pb n="184" xml:id="p184"
              />person was himself endowed with inventive power, he explained the appearances
              according in general to the system of philosophy which he had embraced<note
                place="bottom">Aglaoph. 180. 181.</note>. It was thus that Porphyrius conceived the
              Hierophant to represent the Platonic Demiurgos or creator of the world ; the
              Torch-bearer (<hi rend="i">Daduchos</hi>), the sun ; the Altar-man (<hi rend="i"
                >Epibomios</hi>), the moon ; the Herald (<hi rend="i">Hierokeryx</hi>), Hermes ; and
              the other ministers, the lesser stars. These fancies of priests and philosophers have
              been by modern writers formed into a complete system, and S<hi rend="sup">te</hi>

            <p>It is to be observed, in conclusion, with respect to the charges of impiety and
              immorality brought against the Eleusinian mysteries by some Fathers of the Church,
              that this arose entirely from their confounding them with the Bacchic, Isiac,
              Mithraic, and other <hi rend="i">private</hi> mysteries, mostly imported from Asia,
              which were undoubtedly liable to that imputation. It must always be remembered, that

              were denominated Muses. In Homer they are called the daughters of Zeus<note

            <p>The Muses, says Homer<note place="bottom">Il. ii. 594.</note>, met the Thracian
              Thamyras in Dorion (in the Peloponnese), as he was returning from Œchalia. He had
              boasted that he could excel them in singing ; and enraged at his presumption they
              struck him blind, and deprived him of his knowledge of music.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the birth of the Muses, the nine daughters, it is said, of Pierios king
              of Æmathia challenged them to a contest of singing. The place of trial was Mount
              Helicôn. At the song of the latter the sky became dark and all nature was put out of
              harmony, but at that of the Muses the heaven itself, the stars, the sea, and rivers
              stood motionless, and Helicôn swelled up with delight, so that his summit would have
              reached the sky had not Poseidôn directed Pegasos to strike it with his hoof. The
              Muses then turned the presumptuous maids into nine different kinds of birds<note

                birds are given ; these of course were the names of the nine maids in Nicander.
                Ovid, who also relates the legend (Met. v. 300. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>), says they
                were turned into magpies, and he is followed by Statius (Silv. ii. 4. 19.). The tale
                seems indebted for its origin to the Muses’ name, Pierides, from Pieria.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Muses did not escape the darts of Love. Calliope bore to Œagros a son named
                Linos<note place="bottom">Apollod. i. 3. 2. Others made Apollo the sire of Linos and
                Orpheus. Hesiod (Fr. 97.) said that Urania was the mother of Linos. See Conon
                19.</note>, who was killed by his pupil Heracles. She also had by the same sire
              Orpheus, whose skill on the lyre was such as to move the very trees and rocks, and the
              beasts of the forest assembled round him as he struck its chords. He was married to
                Eurydice<note place="bottom">Argiope according to Hermesianax.</note>, whom he
              tenderly loved ; but a snake having bitten her as she ran through the grass, she died.
              Her disconsolate husband determined to descend to the under-world, to endeavour to
              mollify its rulers, and obtain permission for her to return to the realms of light.
              Hades and Persephone listened to his prayer ; she was allowed to return, on condition
              of his not looking on her till they were arrived in the upper-world. Fearing that she
              might not be following him, the anxious husband looked <pb n="188" xml:id="p188"
              />back, and thereby lost her. He now avoided human society ; and despising the rites
              of Dionysos, was torn to pieces by the Mænades. The Muses collected the fragments of
              his body, and buried them, and at their prayer Zeus placed his lyre in the skies<note

                Homer. According to these mystics (Symb. iii. 148. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>) he was a
                priest of the Light-religion, — that of Apollo or Vishnoo, — and vainly resisted the
                raving orgies of the Dionysos- or Seeva-worship when it reached Greece. See Lobeck’s
                Aglaophamus for all that the most extensive learning, joined with sense and sane
                philosophy, has been able to do toward elucidating the real nature and character of

              musical Sirens were placed by the poets at the edge of the water, possibly from a
              feeling of a connexion between that element and music.</p>
            <p>The Latins, it would also appear, connected their Camenæ with the fountains ; for
              Egeria was one of them, and her fount long continued to be an object of veneration.
              The Gotho-German race (whose language and religion bear so great an affinity to those
              of Greece) seem also to have connected music with the water in their ancient religious
              system ; and this notion still remains part of the popular creed in northern Europe,
              as is proved by the many legends of the songs of Mermaids, Nixes, Necks, and similar
              beings of the waters current among the people in Germany and Scandinavia<note
                place="bottom">The reader will find several of these legends in the Fairy Mythology.
                See for example, vol. i. 234-244.</note>. In fact, this, like <pb n="190"
                xml:id="p190"/>almost every other article of popular belief, has its origin in
              nature. There is music in the sound of water as it purls or murmurs along in the
              rivulet, (the very terms <hi rend="i">prattling, babbling, tinkling</hi>, and such
              like, applied to brooks by our poets prove it,) and even the waterfall, especially
              when heard in the distance, makes melody to the attentive ear. The rivulet is also the
              favourite haunt of the poet ; its quiet murmur induces calmness over the spirit, and
              puts the mind into a frame for the reception of poetic images<note place="bottom"

              drive out of Olympos in the chariot of the former goddess, to share in the conflict of
              the Achæans and the Trojans, the gates of heaven, which the Seasons keep, whose charge
              is to open and close the dense cloud, creak spontaneously to let them pass. On the
              return of these goddesses, at the mandate of Zeus, the Seasons unyoke their steeds,
              fasten them in their stalls, and lay up the chariot. They are also mentioned by
                Poseidôn<note place="bottom">Il. xxi. 450.</note> as bringing round the period at

                in Lobeek, p. 600.</note> the Horæ are called the daughters of Kronos (Time ?), and

              or ten in number<note place="bottom">Hygin. 183.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Horæ seem to have been originally regarded as the presidents of the three seasons

                place="bottom">Il. xxi. 111.</note>, they came to be regarded as presiding over its
              parts also ; and when it was further subdivided into <hi rend="i">hours</hi>, these

            <p>Order and regularity being their prevailing attributes, the transition was easy from
              the natural to the moral world ; and the guardian goddesses of the seasons were
              regarded as presiding over law, justice, and peace, the great producers of order and
              harmony among men.</p>
            <p>It is possible however, but not agreeable to analogy, that the reverse was the case,
              and that the transition was from moral to physical ideas.</p>
            <p>By Pindar<note place="bottom">Ol. xiii. 9.</note> the Horæ are named, in their moral
              capacity, the bestowers of wealth, a poetic clothing of the homely maxim ‘honesty is
              the best policy.’ The Athenians worshiped two Horæ, named Thallo <hi rend="i"

              physical beings<note place="bottom">Paus. ix. 35. 2.</note>. By the poets they were

            <p>The Graces, like the Muses and other sister-goddesses, are spoken of by Homer in the
              plural, and their number is indefinite. They are graceful and beautiful themselves,
              and the bestowers of all grace and beauty both on persons and things. They wove the
              robe of Aphrodite<note place="bottom">Il. v. 338. and that of Dionysos, Apoll. Rh. iv.
                425.</note> ; the beauty of the two attendants of Nausicaa<note place="bottom">Od.
                vi. 18.</note> was given them by the Charites ; and the ringlets of the beautiful
              Euphorbos are compared<note place="bottom">Il. xvii. 51.</note> to those of these
              lovely goddesses. Aphrodite<note place="bottom">Od. xviii. 194.</note> joins in their
              dance ; and in the song of Demodocos, they wash and anoint her, when filled with shame
              she flies to Paphôs<note place="bottom">Od. viii. 364. See also the beautiful fragment
                of the Cypria. Athen. xv. 682.</note>. Yet though they seem to have been
              particularly attached to the goddess of love, the queen of heaven had authority over
                them<note place="bottom">Il. xiv. 267.</note> ; and she promises Pasithea, one of
              the youngest of the Graces, for a wife to Sleep, in return for his aid in deceiving
              Zeus. By later writers she is even said to be their mother<note place="bottom">Nonnus,
                xxxi. 184. Eudocia, 430.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Homeridian hymn to Artemis describes that goddess as going to the ‘great house’
              of her brother at Delphi, and regulating the dance of the Muses and the Graces.</p>
            <p>Zeus, says Hesiod<note place="bottom">Theog. 907.</note>, was by Eurynome, the
              daughter of Ocean, the father of the ‘three fair-cheeked Graces’ Aglaïa (<hi rend="i"
                >Splendour</hi>), Euphrosyne (<hi rend="i">Joy</hi>), and lovely Thalia (<hi
                rend="i">Pleasure</hi>). ‘From their eyes,’ continues the poet, ‘as they gazed,
              distilled care-dispelling love ; and they looked lovely from beneath their brows.’
              According to Antimachus<note place="bottom">Paus. ix. 35. 5.</note>, the Graces were
              the daughters of Helios and Ægle (<hi rend="i">Splendour</hi>) ; and Hermesianax<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id. ut sup.</hi></note> made Peitho (<hi rend="i"

              and Aglaïa<note place="bottom">Dionys. xxiv. 263.</note>.</p>
            <p>Orchomenos in Bœotia was the chief seat of the worship of these goddesses. Its
              introduction was ascribed to <pb n="193" xml:id="p193"/>Eteocles, the son of the river

            <p>The Graces were at all times in the creed of Greece the goddesses presiding over

              subsequent poets in general.</p>
            <p>There was a cave at the river Amnisos, near Gortyna in Crete, sacred to Eileithyia,

            <p>It is not by any means an improbable supposition, that <pb n="194" xml:id="p194"

              Hence, if Artemis was originally a moon-goddess, the identification of them was easy.
              The moon was believed by the ancients to have great influence over growth in
                general<note place="bottom">“Crescente luna frumenta grandescunt.” Plin. H. N.

              natural to conceive that the moon-goddess presided over the birth of children.</p>

            <p>In the Ilias, with the exception of one passage<note place="bottom">Il. xx.
                49.</note>, the Moira is spoken of in the singular number and as a person, almost
              exactly as we use the word <hi rend="i">Fate.</hi> But in the Odyssey this word is
              used as a common substantive, followed by a genitive of the person, and signifying <hi
                rend="i">Decree.</hi></p>
            <p>The Theogony of Hesiod limits the Fates, like so many other goddesses, to three, and
              gives them Zeus and Themis for their parents<note place="bottom">Theog. 904.</note>.
              In an interpolated passage of the Theogony<note place="bottom">Theog. 217.</note> they
              are classed among the children of Night<note place="bottom">Theog. 217.</note>, and
              Plato makes them the daughters of Necessity<note place="bottom">Rep. x. 617.</note>.
              Their names in Hesiod are Clotho <hi rend="i">(Spinster)</hi>, Lachesis <hi rend="i"
                >(Allotter)</hi>, and Atropos <hi rend="i">(Unchangeable)</hi> ; but he does not
              speak of their spinning the destinies of men. This office of theirs is however noticed
              both in the Ilias and the Odyssey. In the former it is said<note place="bottom">Il.
                xx. 127.</note> by Hera of Achilleus, that the gods will protect him that day, but
              that hereafter he will suffer ‘what Aisa [a name synonymous with Moira] span with her

            <pb n="195" xml:id="p195"/><p>It is probable that Homer, in accordance with the sublime
              fiction in the Theogony, regarded the Fates as the offspring of Zeus and Order, for in

                things<note place="bottom">See Nitzsch on Od. iii. 236.</note>. Æschylus<note
                place="bottom">Prom. 515. See also Herod. i. 91.</note> makes even Zeus himself

            <p>These goddesses are frequently named by Homer, but he says nothing of their origin.
              In the Theogony they spring from the blood of Uranos when mutilated by his son Kronos,
              whose own children they are according to Empedocles<note place="bottom">See above,

            <p>The Greek term <hi rend="i">ἐρινὺς</hi> has, we think, been justly defined<note
                place="bottom">Müller, Eumen. 186.</note> as a “feeling of deep offence, of bitter
              displeasure, at the impious violation of our sacred rights by those most bound to <pb
                n="197" xml:id="p197"/>respect them.” This perfectly accords with the origin of the
              Erinnyes in the Theogony, and with those passages of the Homeric poems in which they
              are mentioned ; for they are there invoked to avenge the breach of filial duty<note
                place="bottom">Il. ix. 454, 568 ; compare Il. xxi. 412. Od. ii. 135.</note>, and are
              named as the punishers of perjury<note place="bottom">Il. xix. 258 ; compare Il. iii.
                278.</note> : even beggars have their Erinnyes, that they may not be insulted with
                impunity<note place="bottom">Od. xvii. 475.</note> ; and when a horse has spoken in
              violation of the order of nature, the Erinnyes deprive him of the power of repeating
              the act<note place="bottom">Il. xix. 418.</note>. The Erinnyes, these personified
              feelings, may therefore be regarded as the maintainers of order both in the moral and
              the natural world. There is however another view taken of these goddesses, in which
              they are only a form of Demeter and Kora, the great goddesses of the earth. For
              everything in nature having injurious as well as beneficial effects, the bounteous
              earth itself becomes at times grim, as it were, and displeased with mankind, and this
              is Demeter-Erinnys. In the Arcadian legends of this goddess, and in the concluding
              choruses of the Eumenides of Æschylus, may be discerned ideas of this nature<note

            <p>The office of Iris, in the Ilias, is to act as the messenger of the king and queen of
              Olympos, a duty which is performed by Hermes in the Odyssey, in which poem there is
              not any mention made of Iris. Homer gives not the slightest hint of who her parents
              were ; but analogy might lead to the <pb n="199" xml:id="p199"/>supposition of Zeus
              being her sire, by some mother who is unknown. Hesiod<note place="bottom">Theog.
                265.</note> says that <hi rend="i">swift</hi> Iris and the Harpies, who fly ‘like
              the blasts of the winds or the birds,’ were the children of Thaumas (<hi rend="i"
                >Wonder</hi>) by Electra (<hi rend="i">Brightness</hi>) the daughter of Oceanos. It
              is evidently the <hi rend="i">Rainbow</hi> (<hi rend="i">ἴρις</hi>) that is meant,
              which is thus personified in the usual theogonic manner. There is little mention of
              Iris in the subsequent Greek poets ; but, whenever she is spoken of, she appears quite
              distinct from the celestial phænomenon of the same name. In Callimachus<note
                place="bottom">Hymn to Delos, 216. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> and the Latin

              service of Hera ; and by these last she is invariably, and even we may say clumsily,
              confounded with the rainbow. According to the lyric poet Alcæus, who is followed by
              Nonnus, Iris was by Zephyros the mother of Love<note place="bottom">See above,

              commits it to the twin brothers Sleep and Death to convey to Lycia, there to be
              interred by his relatives and friends.</p>
            <p>In the same poem, when Hera<note place="bottom">Il. xiv. 230. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>
                imitated by Nonnus, xxxi. 103. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> resolves by her arts
              and beauty to melt the soul of Zeus in love, and lay him asleep on Mount Gargaros,
              that Poseidôn may meanwhile give victory to the Achæans, she takes her way thither
              from Olympos over Lemnos, where she meets Sleep. She accosts him as the king of all
              gods and men, and prays him to aid in her project, promising as his reward a seat and
              footstool, the workmanship <pb n="201" xml:id="p201"/>of Hephæstos. Sleep reminds the
              goddess of the imminent danger which he formerly ran, for having at her desire sealed
              the eyes of Zeus in slumber when Heracles was on his return from Troy, during which
              she raised a storm that drove the hero to Côs ; and Zeus, awaking in a rage, knocked
              the gods about the house, searching for Sleep, who only escaped by seeking the
              protection of Night, whom Zeus revered too much to offend. Hera, by urging that the
              affection of Zeus for the Trojans could not be supposed equal to that for his own son,
              and finally by offering and swearing to give him one of the younger Graces for his
              spouse, overcomes the fears of Sleep, who accompanies her to Ida, where taking the
              shape of a bird he sits in a tree till she has beguiled her lord. Sleep, having
              accomplished his task, speeds to the battle-field to inform Poseidôn of what he has

            <p>The name of this goddess comes most simply from <hi rend="i">νέμω, to

              infractions of order was a part of her office, she was chiefly viewed as the punisher
              of pride, insolence, and arrogance. This is her usual character in the dramatists.</p>

            <p>Fortune, that unseen power which exercises such arbitrary dominion over human

            <head><hi rend="i">Personifications</hi>.</head>
            <p>The practice of personifying natural and moral qualities (of which the preceding
              articles are instances), seems to have been coeval with Grecian poetry and religion.
              It was not however by any means peculiar to Greece ; it will probably be found
              wherever poetry exists<note place="bottom">See the fine personification of Wisdom in
                the Proverbs of Solomon, ch. viii.</note>. But it was only in ancient Greece and
              Italy that these personifications were objects of worship, and seemed to be regarded
              as having a real personal existence.</p>
            <p>In Homer, to whom as the original fountain we continually revert, we meet a number of
              these moral qualities appearing as persons. Terror and Fear, the children of Ares and
              Strife his sister, rouse with him the Trojans to battle<note place="bottom">Il. iv.
                440.</note>. Strife is said to be small at first, but at last to raise her head to
              the heaven. She is sent forth<note place="bottom">Il. xi. 3.</note> amidst the Achæans
              by Zeus, bearing the signal of war ; and, standing on the ship of Odysseus in the
              centre of the fleet, shouts so as to be heard at either extremity. When Ares<note
                place="bottom">Il. xv. 120.</note> hears of the death of his son Ascalaphos, Terror
              and Fear are commanded to yoke the steeds to his car for the war.</p>
            <p>Prayers (Λ<hi rend="i">ιταὶ</hi>), says the poet<note place="bottom">Il. ix.
                502.</note>, are the daughters of great Zeus, lame and wrinkled, with squinting
              eyes. They follow Mischief (Ἂ<hi rend="i">τη</hi>), and tend those whom she has
              injured : but Ate is strong and firm-footed, and gets far before them, afflicting men
              whom they afterwards heal. Elsewhere<note place="bottom">Il. xix. 91. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi></note> he relates that Ate is the daughter of Zeus, who <hi rend="i"
                >injures</hi> (ἀ<hi rend="i">âται</hi>) all ; that her feet are tender, and that she
              therefore does not walk on the ground, but on the heads of men. Having conspired with
              Hera to deceive her father, he took her by the hair <pb n="204" xml:id="p204"/>and
              flung her to earth, with an oath that she should never return to Olympos.</p>
            <p>The Theogony of Hesiod contains a number of these personified qualities ; they also
              occur in the subsequent poets. Thus Æschylus introduced on the stage Strength (Κ<hi

              terms Fame ‘the child of golden Hope’<note place="bottom">Œd. Tyr. 157.</note> ; and
              the Athenians erected an altar to this personification<note place="bottom">Paus. i.

              political constitution they were occasionally stimulated to deeds of cruelty by their
              unprincipled demagogues, the Athenians were by nature one of the most humane people in

            <p>Wealth (Π<hi rend="i">λοȗτος</hi>) was also deified. The Theogony makes him very
              appropriately the offspring of Demeter by Iasios<note place="bottom">Theog. 969 ; see

            <p rend="noindent">No deity of Grecian mythology has given occasion to greater mysticism
              than Dionysos, the god of wine. Creuzer<note place="bottom">Symbolik.</note>, for
              example, the prince of mystics, deduces his worship from India, and makes him
              identical with the Seeva of that country. According to him, the Vishnoo-religion had,
              at a period far beyond that of history, spread itself over the West, and in Greece was
              known as that of Apollo, the god of the sun and light. The wild religion of Seeva,
              which had overcome the milder one of Vishnoo on their natal soil, followed it in its
              progress to the West, proceeded as the religion of Dionysos through Egypt and anterior
              Asia, mingling itself with the systems of these countries, and entered Greece, where,
              after a long struggle with the Apollo-system, the two religions finally coalesced, the
              Dionysiac casting away some of its wildest and most extravagant practices.</p>
            <p>This hypothesis rests on no stable evidence ; and it has been, as appears to us,
              fully refuted and exposed by the sober and sagacious Voss<note place="bottom"
                >Anti-Symbolik.</note>, who, rejecting all air-built theory, bases his system on
              fact and testimony alone. We shall here attempt, chiefly under his guidance, to
              illustrate the changes which it is probable the mythology of this god gradually
              underwent after the time of Homer.</p>
            <p>It has been very justly observed by Lobeck<note place="bottom">Aglaophamus,
                p. 283.</note>, that almost all the passages in Homer in which there is any mention
              of or allusion to this god have been suspected by the ancient critics, either on
              account of some circumstances in themselves, or because they occur in places justly
              liable to suspicion. The first of these passages is that in the sixth book of the
                Ilias<note place="bottom">Il. vi. 130.</note>, <pb n="206" xml:id="p206"/>where
              Diomedes and Glaucos encounter in the field of battle. Here the former hero, who had
              just wounded no less than two deities, asks the latter if he is a god, adding, “ I
              would not fight with the celestial gods ; for the stout Lycurgos, son of Dryas, who
              contended with the celestial gods, was pot longlived, who once chased the nurses of
              raging Dionysos through the holy Nyseïon, but they all flung their sacred utensils
                (θ<hi rend="i">ύσλα</hi>) to the ground, when beaten by the ox-goad of the
              man-slaying Lycurgos ; and Dionysos in affright plunged into the waves of the sea, and
              Thetis received him in her bosom terrified, — for great fear possessed him from the
              shouting of the man. The gods, who live at ease, then hated him, and the son of Kronos
              made him blind ; nor was he long-lived, since he was odious to all the immortal gods.”
              Language more unsuitable surely could not be put into the mouth of Diomedes ; and we
              may observe that there is a kind of instinct of propriety, as we may term it, which
              always guides those poets who sing from inspiration and not from art, leading them to
              ascribe to the personages whom they introduce no ideas and no language but what
              accurately correspond to their situation and character. This consideration alone, when
              well weighed, may suffice to render the above passage extremely suspicious.</p>
            <p>The passage in the fourteenth book<note place="bottom">Il. xiv. 325.</note>, in which
              Zeus so indecorously recounts his various amours to Hera, is liable to the same
              objection, and was rejected by Aristarchus and several of the best critics of
              antiquity. In this the god says that ‘Semele bore him Dionysos, <hi rend="i">a joy to
                mortals.</hi>’ The place in which Andromache is compared to a Mænas<note
                place="bottom">Il. xxii. 460.</note>, besides that it occurs in one of the latter
              books, is regarded as an interpolation.</p>
            <p>These are the only passages in the Ilias in which there is any allusion to Dionysos.
              In the Odyssey<note place="bottom">Od. xi. 325.</note> it is said that Artemis slew
              Ariadne in the isle of Dia, ‘on the testimony (<hi rend="i">μαρτuρίῃσιν</hi>) of
              Dionysos’ ; but the circumstance of the <hi rend="i">o</hi> in the second syllable of
              his name being short in this place satisfied the grammarian Herodian, and ought to
              satisfy any <pb n="207" xml:id="p207"/>one, that the line in question is spurious. In
              the last book of this poem<note place="bottom">Od. xxiv. 74.</note> Thetis is said to
              have brought an urn (ἀμϕιϕορῆα), the gift of Dionysos, to receive the ashes
              of Achilleus ; but the spuriousness of that part of the poem is well known. It was
              further observed by the ancient critics, that Marôn, who gave the wine to Odysseus,
              was the priest of Apollo, not of Dionysos.</p>
            <p>Hesiod<note place="bottom">Theog. 940.</note> says, that Cadmeian Semele bore to Zeus
              ‘the joyfull Dionysos, a mortal an immortal, but now they both are gods.’ Again<note
                place="bottom">Theog. 947.</note>, ‘gold-tressed Dionysos made blond Ariadne the
              daughter of Minôs his blooming spouse, and Kroniôn made her ageless and immortal.’</p>
            <p>Far perhaps inferior in point of antiquity to Hesiod is the Homeridian hymn to
              Dionysos, which contains the following adventure of the god, — a tale which Ovid<note
                place="bottom">Met. iii. 532. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Hygin. 134.</note> has narrated
              somewhat differently.</p>
            <p>Dionysos once let himself be seen as a handsome youth on the shore of a desert
              island. Some Tyrsenian pirates were sailing by, who when they espied him jumped on
              shore and made him captive, thinking him to be of royal birth. They bound him with
              cords ; but these instantly fell off him, and the god sat smiling in silence. The
              pilot perceiving these apparent signs of divinity, called to the crew that he was a
              god, and exhorted them to set him on shore, lest he should cause a tempest to come on.
              But the captain rebuked him sharply, desired him to mind his own business, and
              declared that they would take their captive to Egypt or elsewhere and sell him for a
              slave. They then set sail, the wind blew fresh, and they were proceeding merrily
              along ; when, behold ! streams of fragrant wine began to flow along the ship ; vines
              with clustering grapes spread over the sail ; and ivy, laden with berries, ran up the
              mast and sides of the vessel. His shipmates in affright now called aloud to the pilot
              to make for the land ; but the god assuming the form of a grim lion seized the
              captain, and the terrified crew to escape him leaped into the sea and became dolphins.
              The pilot alone remained <pb n="208" xml:id="p208"/>on board ; the god then declared
              to him who he was, and took him under his protection.</p>
            <p>Another of these hymns relates, that the Nymphs received Dionysos from his father,
              and reared him in a fragrant cavern of the valleys of Nysa. He was counted among the
              Immortals ; and when he grew up, he went through the woody vales crowned with bay and
              ivy : the Nymphs followed him, and the wood was filled with their joyous clamour.</p>
            <p>In these poems the mention of the ivy, and the epithet <hi rend="i">noisy</hi> (<hi
                rend="i">ἐρίβρομς</hi>), testify, as we shall see, their late age. Pindar also calls
              Dionysos <hi rend="i">Ivy-bearing</hi> (<hi rend="i">κισσοϕόρος</hi>) and <hi rend="i"
                >noisy</hi> (<hi rend="i">βρόμιος</hi>). Herodotus and the tragedians describe what
              we consider to be the mixed religion of Dionysos.</p>
            <p>The idea of mere mortals, or the offspring of gods and mortals, being raised to
              divine rank and power, does not occur in the Ilias. Ganymedes and Tithonos, who were
              mortal by both father and mother, were carried off, the former by the gods to be the
              cup-bearer of Zeus<note place="bottom">Il. xx. 234.</note>, the latter by Eôs ; and it
              is to be presumed, though Homer does not expressly say so, that they were endowed with
              immortality. But all the <hi rend="i">halfcaste</hi>, as we may call them, Heracles,
              Achilleus, Sarpedôn, Æneias, have no advantage over their fellow-mortals, except
              greater strength and more frequent aid from the gods.</p>
            <p>But in the Odyssey we find the system of deification commenced. The sea-goddess
              Ino-Leucothea, who gives Odysseus her veil to save him from being drowned, was, we are
              told, a daughter of Cadmos (a name which does not occur in the Ilias), ‘who had before
              been a speaking mortal, but was now allotted the honour of the gods in the depths of
              the sea.’ And again ; Odysseus beholds in the realms of Hades the <hi rend="i"
                >image</hi> (<hi rend="i">εἴδωλογ</hi>) of Heracles, pursuing his usual occupations
              when on earth ; but <hi rend="i">himself</hi> we are told ‘enjoys banquets among the
              immortal gods, and possesses fair-ankled Hebe.’ It is not however said that he had
              obtained the power of a god<note place="bottom">Od. v. 333 ; xi. 601. The last of
                these passages is undoubtedly spurious, and the first is perhaps not altogether free
                from suspicion.</note>.</p>

            <pb n="n.p."/><p>Supposing therefore Dionysos to have been, as his name might appear to
              indicate, one of the original Grecian deities, (and it is difficult to think that the
              vine and its produce, with which the ‘sons of the Achæans’ were so familiar, could
              have been without a presiding god,) he may have been regarded as a son of Zeus by a
              goddess named Semele, who in after-times, in pursuance of a practice hereafter to be
              explained, may have been degraded to the rank of a heroine, and Dionysos have
              consequently become the son of Zeus by a mortal mother. The vintage is in
              wine-countries at the present day, like haymaking and harvest-home in England, a time
              of merry-making and festivity ; and the festival of the deity presiding over it may
              have been a very joyous one, and celebrated with abundance of noise and mirth. Such,
              we say, <hi rend="i">may</hi> have been (for we venture not to assert it) the original
              Dionysiac religion of Greece ; and when we recollect the very incidental manner in
              which Demeter, undoubtedly one of the most ancient deities, is noticed in the Ilias,
              it should not excite any great surprise to find the poet totally omitting all mention
              of the wine-god<note place="bottom">See end of this chapter.</note>.</p>
            <p>To pass from conjecture to certainty, it appears quite clear that the part of Thrace
              lying along the northern coast of the Ægæan was in the earliest times a chief seat of
              the Dionysiac religion, where the worship of the god of wine was celebrated with great
              noise and tumult by the people of that country ; and, supposing the passage in the
              sixth book of the Ilias to be genuine, some account of it had possibly reached the
              ears of Homer. The Thracian worship of Dionysos, it is not improbable, was not
              introduced into Greece till after the time when the Æolians colonised the coast of

            <p>There can be no doubt of the Dionysiac religion, with its nocturnal orgies and
              indecent extravagance, having been very prevalent among the Greeks at the time when
              the Ionians were permitted to settle in Egypt. It is in no small degree surprising
              with what facility the Grecian and Egyptian systems coalesced, with what open-mouthed
              credulity the Grecian settlers and travellers swallowed all the fictions of the
              cunning priesthood of that country, and with what barefaced assurance the latter
              palmed on their unsuspecting auditors the most incredible lies. In reading the Euterpe
              of Herodotus, one might fancy one’s self beholding Captain Wilford listening with
              devout belief to his artful Pundit<note place="bottom">See the Asiatic

            <p>The theory boldly advanced by the Egyptian priesthood was, that all the religion of
              Greece had been imported into <pb n="211" xml:id="p211"/>that country by colonies of
              Egyptians — a people, by the way, without ships, or materials for building them, who

              taught the art of wine-making in that country, made a conquering expedition through
              the world, to instruct mankind in the culture of the vine and other useful arts. And
              thus the knowledge of the vine came to Greece, from a land which does not produce that

              supported by all the efforts of ingenious etymology.</p>
            <p>The story of the Grecian Dionysos is as follows<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii.
                4-5. Ovid, Met. iii. 253. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Hygin. 167. 179. Eudoc. 118.
                373.</note>. Zeus, enamoured of the beauty of Semele the daughter of Cadmos, visited
              her in secret. Hera’s jealousy took alarm, and under the form of an old woman she came
              to Semele, and, by exciting doubts of the real character of her lover, induced her
              when next he came to exact a promise that he would visit her as he was wont to visit
              Hera. An unwary promise was thus drawn from the god before he knew what he was
              required to perform ; and he therefore entered the bower of Semele in his chariot, the
              lightning and thunder flaming, flashing and roaring around him. Overcome with terror,
              Semele, who was now six months gone with child, expired in the flames, and Zeus took
              the babe, which was prematurely expelled from her womb, and sewed it up in his thigh.
              In due time it came to the birth, and Zeus then naming it Dionysos gave it to <pb
                n="213" xml:id="p213"/>Hermes to convey to Ino, the sister of Semele, with
              directions to rear it as a girl.</p>
            <p>Hera, whose revenge was not yet satiated, caused Athamas, the husband of Ino, to go
              mad ; and Zeus, to save Dionysos from the machinations of Hera, changed him into a
              kid, under which form Hermes conveyed him to the nymphs of Nysa, who were afterwards
              made the Hyades, and by whom he was reared. When he grew up he discovered the culture
              of the vine, and the mode of extracting its precious liquor ; but Hera struck him with
              madness, and he roamed through great part of Asia. In Phrygia Rhea cured him, and
              taught him her religious rites, which he now resolved to introduce into Hellas. When
              passing through Thrace he was so furiously assailed by Lycurgos, a prince of the
              country, that he was obliged to take refuge with Thetis in the sea ; but he avenged
              himself by driving Lycurgos mad, who killed his own son Dryas with a blow of an axe,
              taking him for a vine-branch ; and his subjects afterwards bound him and left him on
              Mount Pangæon, where he was destroyed by wild horses, for such was the will of
              Dionysos.</p>
            <p>When Dionysos reached his native city, the women readily received the new rites, and
              ran wildly through the woods of Cithærôn. Pentheus, the ruler of Thebes, however, set
              himself against them ; but Dionysos caused him to be torn to pieces by his mother and
              his aunts. The daughters of Minyas, Leucippe, Aristippe and Alcathoe, also despised
              his rites, and continued plying their looms, while the other women ran through the
              mountains. He came as a maiden, and remonstrated, but in vain ; he then assumed the
              form of various wild beasts ; serpents filled their baskets ; vines and ivy twined
              round their looms, while wine and milk distilled from the roof ; but their obstinacy
              was unsubdued. He finally drove them mad ; they tore to pieces the son of Leucippe,
              and then went roaming through the mountains, till Hermes touched them with his wand,
              and turned them into a bat, an owl, and a crow<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 4-5.

              Diodorus gives us, probably from the cyclograph Dionysius, the following
                narrative<note place="bottom">Diodor. iii. 68. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Ammôn, a monarch of Libya, was married to Rhea, a daughter of Uranos ; but meeting
              near the Ceraunian mountains a beautiful maiden named Amaltheia, he became enamoured
              of her. He made her mistress of the adjacent fruitful country, which from its
              resembling a bull’s horn in form was named the Western Horn, and then Amaltheia’s
              Horn, which last name was afterwards given to places similar to it in fertility.
              Amaltheia here bore him a son, whom, fearing the jealousy of Rhea, he conveyed to a
              town named Nysa, situated not far from the Horn, in an island formed by the river
              Tritôn. He committed the care of him to Nysa, one of the daughters of Aristæos ; while
              Athena, who had lately sprung from the earth on the banks of the Tritôn, was appointed
              to keep guard against the assaults of Rhea. This delicious isle, which was precipitous
              on all sides, with a single entrance through a narrow glen thickly shaded by trees, is
              described in a similar manner with Panchaia, and other happy retreats of the same <pb

              trees of every kind, flowers of all hues, and evermore resounded with the melody of

              the dramatists, they do not appear to have been narrated in continuity, like those of
              Heracles, until long after the decline of Grecian poetry. It was in the fifth century
              of the Christian æra, that Nonnus, a native of Panopolis in Egypt, made the history of
              Dionysos the subject of a poem, containing forty-eight books, the wildest and
              strangest that can well be conceived, more resembling the Ramayuna of India than
              anything to be found in ancient or modern occidental literature. Its chief subject is
              the war of Dionysos against Deriades king of the Indians, the details of which are

            <p>It seems probable that in the original conception of Dionysos he was not merely the
              wine-god, for such restricted notions are contrary to the genius of the ancient
              Grecian religion, in which each people assigned its peculiar deities a very extensive
              sphere of action, as gods of the sun, the moon, the heaven, the earth, and other parts
              of nature. Dionysos was therefore, it is likely, regarded as a deity presiding over
              growth and increase in general ; and as Hermes, who seems to have been originally of
              coextensive power with him, was gradually restricted and made a god of cattle alone,
              so Dionysos may have been limited to the care of plants, particularly the vine<note

            <p>Water and heat being the great causes of growth, we find this deity closely connected

              heat ; and perhaps the true origin of the god’s own epithet, Μηρογϵνὴς, usually
              rendered Thigh-born, lies in this word. It is not impossible that the real root of his
              mother’s name may be ϭέλɑς. <note place="bottom">Schwenk, 147.</note>.</p>
            <p>In favour of this god’s presiding over cattle is alleged the well-known circumstance
              of the goat being the victim offered to him ; his being in his infancy conveyed to
              Nysa in the form of a kid, and his being worshiped under that name. He also wore the
              goatskin dress of the goatherds ; and in Attica and Hermione he was named Μϵλάνɑιγις,
              a name which in the former place was connected with the fabulous origin of the
              festival of the Apaturia. Welcker is of opinion that Dionysos was originally the
              object of worship to the lower classes, the goatherds, and such like (in Attica the
              tribe of the Ægicoreis) ; and that as they gradually rose in consideration, their god
              was associated with those of the nobles ; and that thence he always appeared of an
              inferior rank to those with whom he was joined. This critic accounts on the same
              principle for the very slight mention of Dionysos in the Homeric poems, namely, that
              he was of too low a rank to be an actor of importance in those aristocratie verses,
              which only told of kings and nobles, and the gods whom they adored<note place="bottom"

            <p>The name Dionysos is one of the most difficult to explain <pb n="219" xml:id="p219"

              of its being the same with Devanishi, a title of the Hindoo god Seeva, and view in
              Dionysos a Grecian god with a Grecian name. The most probable (though by no means
              quite satisfactory) interpretation of it is God-of-Nysa, which last place occurs
              frequently in his legend. Like Tritôn, however, it has been multiplied, for we find a
              Nysa on Helicôn in Bœotia<note place="bottom">Strabo, ix. 1. See Müller, Orchom. 89.

            give a slight view of the manner in which the intercourse with Asia and Egypt, which had
            such an injurious effect on the religion of Greece, commenced. We know not how we can
            better open the subject, than by quoting the following just and philosophical
            observations of a writer<note place="bottom">Lobeck, Aglaophamus, 312. <hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi></note> for whom we entertain the highest respect and esteem.</p>
          <p>“After that most happy age whose image we behold expressed in the poems of Homer had
            passed away, a great change took place in civil affairs, but a still greater in
            religions, in pursuits, and inclinations ; and the whole of Greece was so much altered,
            that if any one passes from the perusal of Homer to that of those writers who lived in
            the time of the Persian war, he will feel as if removed to another region, and seem
            hardly to recognise those old Achæans, who, happy with the present, careless of the
            future, prompt to act, mindless of what they had done, were aloof from all the causes of
            anxiety and superstition. But when, as reason gradually ripened, the Greeks began to
            examine the involved conceptions of the mind, and to know themselves, there succeeded
            that more mature and solicitous age, at which when men arrive they feel more strongly
            and acutely the incentives of pleasure and of virtue, fluctuating alternately, with
            great commotion of mind, and often with extreme <hi rend="i">ennui</hi>, between what
            they condemn and what they desire. Hence that anxiety about hidden matters, and those
            presages of the future, and the various superstitions which consciousness of guilt and
            despair of salvation are wont to produce. The entrance and traces of this new age of
            Greece we are prevented from clearly discerning by the obscurity of those times, which,
            being illumined by hardly <pb n="221" xml:id="p221"/>any literary monuments, may be said
            to resemble a region covered with dark clouds, through which the tops of the towers and
            castles elevate themselves, while the ground and foundation lie concealed. But that
            there was a great agitation of the human mind, and some new efforts, is proved by the
            perfection of lyric poetry, which commenced a little after the time of Hesiod, and by
            the origin of philosophy and the advance of the elegant arts. We presently see
            magnificent temples raised to the gods and heroes, solemn games instituted throughout
            the towns, the number and the insignia of the priests, especially when the regal power
            had been abolished, increased. But that at the same time the mystic ceremonies, whose
            first traces appear in the Hesiodic and Cyclic poems, were diffused far and wide, and
            occupied the whole of life with new superstitions, is manifest from the number of
            jugglers who then roved through Greece, expiating by certain secret rites not only blood
            and man-slaughter, but also prodigies, sacrileges, and whatever piacular offences either
            individuals or states had committed.”</p>
          <p>Having enumerated the principal of these men, such as Abaris, Aristeas, Onomacritus of
            Locris, and Epimenides, our author thus proceeds :</p>
          <p>“Meantime Egypt, the parent of superstition and sacerdotal falsehood, was laid open ;
            and who that reflects on the long and frequent intercourse of the two nations, and the
            vaniloquence of the one and the credulity of the other<note place="bottom">Compare Paus.
              ix. 36, 5. Ukert, I. i. 51. <hi rend="i">note.</hi></note>, will hesitate to concede
            that the contagion had secretly insinuated itself into Greece before the time of
            Pythagoras ? But it is not without reason believed, that during the same period the
            mystic poems of Musæos, Eumolpos, Orpheus, and that which was called the Minyas, were
            made public ; in all of which were scattered new fables about the lower-world, and hopes
            of a more happy life and Elysian abodes promised to those who received the sacred
            decrees of the gods, and equal punishments threatened to the despisers of them. What !
            is not the religion of the subterrane deities sanctioned by those Athenian laws, which
            direct that those who have committed manslaughter should be brought before the King of
            the Sacred <pb n="222" xml:id="p222"/>Affairs, and being absolved by the judgement
            should be solemnly purified, — of which laws Dracôn is said to have been the author ?
            This religion was also confirmed by Solôn ; who, in cases of manslaughter, directed to
            swear by three deities, Ikesios, Catharsios, and Exakesterios. Nor were the psychomanty
            and evocations of the dead, which we read of in the stories of Archilochus, Periander,
            and Pausanias, built on any other foundation : and these were posterior to Homer ; for
            if his contemporaries had known anything of that art, he needed not to have sent
            Odysseus to the nether-world. After a little interval succeeded Pythagoras, the author
            of a portentous wisdom, and that twilight-season in which poets began to philosophise
            and philosophers to poetise.</p>
          <p>“In these four centuries, therefore, which elapsed between Homer and the Persian wars,
            the greatest change was made in all matters pertaining to the worship of the gods. They
            contain the origin and growth of solemn lustrations, mysteries, hieratic medicine, and
            fanatic poetry : in these too the most ancient poems of Bacis, Pamphôs, Olên, and the
            Sibyls, appear to have been patched up, and all the avenues of pious frauds thrown open.
            Whence the conclusion is easy, that the web of the Orphic fable, which is all composed
            of the same kind of threads with those, was not woven by Proselenian philosophers, but
            was commenced perhaps a century or two after Homer, and completed a little before the
            time of Onomacritus<note place="bottom">Compare Müller, Proleg. 387.</note>.”</p>
          <p>It is needless to remind our readers, that we have no account on which we can place
            reliance of any intercourse between the Greeks and foreign nations previous to the
            Trojan war, save the commercial one with the Phœnician merchants who visited their
            harbours. The revolution named the Return of the Heracleids, which is said to have
            occurred somewhat less than a century after that event, caused portions of the Achæan
            race to abandon their country and seek new settlements. They seem to have turned their
            eyes to the former realms of the Trojan monarchs, whose power had been broken ; and the
            first colonies were planted by the Æolians along the coast, from the island of Cyzicos
            in the Propontis to the mouth <pb n="223" xml:id="p223"/>of the Hermos. The Ionians and
            the Dorians afterwards came and settled to the south of that river ; and thus the coast
            of Asia was occupied to a considerable extent by the Grecian colonies.</p>
          <p>We cannot trace in Homer any difference between the religion of the Achæans and that of
            the Asiatics. In the case of the Trojans, who are regarded (and we think justly) as a
            portion of the Pelasgic race, this need not surprise us ; but the poet is equally silent
            with respect to anything of thé kind between them and the Phrygians, whose religion we
            know to have been different<note place="bottom">Müller, Dor. i. 10.</note>. It does not
            however seem to have been the practice of the <hi rend="i">Aœdi</hi> to attend to
            distinctions of this kind ; for Odysseus, we may observe, in all his wanderings never
            found any want of an interpreter, as good Greek was spoken wherever he came, and he
            everywhere met with Grecian manners and customs. The silence therefore of the poet
            throws no impediment in the way of our assuming that, when the Grecian colonies settled
            on the Hellespont, they found there a religion very different from their own ; the one
            being calm and cheerful, the other wild and orgiastic. This religion was that of</p>

            <p>Cybele, called also the Great Mother, was regarded by the Phrygians and Lydians<note
                place="bottom">Herod. v. 102.</note> as the goddess of nature or of the earth. Her
              temples stood on the summits of hills ; such as that of Dindymos in the isle of
              Cyzicos, of Berecynthos, Sipylos, Cybelos ; from which last she is said to have
              derived her name, though the reverse is more likely to be the truth. At Pessinos was
              preserved the aërolite<note place="bottom">See our note on Ovid’s Fasti, iv.
                276.</note> which was held to be her heaven-sent image.</p>
            <p>The following pragmatised account of Cybele is given by Diodorus.</p>
            <p>Cybele was daughter to king Mæôn and his queen Dindyme. She was exposed by her father
              on Mount Cybelos, where she was suckled by panthers and lionesses, and was afterwards
              reared by shepherdesses, who named her Cybele. <pb n="224" xml:id="p224"/>When she
              grew up she displayed great skill in the healing art, and cured all the diseases of
              the children and cattle. They thence called her the <hi rend="i">Mountain-Mother.</hi>
              While dwelling in the woods she formed a strict friendship with Marsyas, and had a
              love-affair with a youth named Attis. She was afterwards acknowledged by her parents ;
              but her father, on discovering her intimacy with Attis, seized that unhappy youth and
              put him to death. Grief deprived Cybele of her reason : with dishevelled locks she
              roamed, to the sound of the drums and pipes which she had invented, over various
              regions of the earth, even as far as the country of the Hyperboreans, teaching mankind
              agriculture : her companion was still the faithful Marsyas. Meantime a dreadful famine
              ravaged Phrygia : the oracle, on being consulted, directed that the body of Attis
              should be buried, and divine honours be paid to Cybele. A stately temple was
              accordingly erected to her at Pessinos by king Midas<note place="bottom">Diodor. iii.
                58, 59. He probably took his account of Cybele from Dionysius of Samos, not from
                Xanthos the Lydian, as Creuzer (Symb. ii. 46.) supposes. See Lobeck, 640. <hi
                  rend="i">note.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>It is apparent from this account that Cybele, Marsyas, and Attis were all ancient
              Phrygian deities. Marsyas, as we have seen, was a river-god ; and Attis, whose name
              occurs frequently in the dynasties of the Lydian kings, (who according to the usual
              practice were named after their god,) was probably, like Adonis, a personification of
              the Sun, of whose union with Earth we have apparently another instance in Amphiôn and
              Niobe. The Lydian legend of the birth of Attis is curious and significant<note
                place="bottom">Paus. vii. 17, 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>Like Asiatic worship in general, that of Cybele was <hi rend="i">enthusiastic.</hi>
              Her priests, named Galli and Corybantes, ran about with dreadful cries and howlings,
              beating on timbrels, clashing cymbals, sounding pipes, and cutting their flesh with
              knives. The box-tree and the cypress were considered sacred to her ; as from the
              former she made the pipes, and Attis was said to have been changed into the
              latter.</p>
            <p>We find from Pindar and the dramatists<note place="bottom">Pind. Pyth. iii. 137. <hi

              that the worship <pb n="225" xml:id="p225"/>and the mysteries of the Great Mother were

              the goddess was conveyed to Rome ; where a stately temple was built to receive her,
              and a solemn festival named the Megalesia was celebrated every year in her honour<note

            <p>In works of art Cybele exhibits the matronly air and composed dignity which
              distinguish Hera and Demeter. Sometimes she is veiled, and seated on a throne with
              lions at her side ; at other times riding in a chariot drawn by lions. Her head is
              always crowned with towers. She frequently beats on a drum, and bears a sceptre in her
              hand.</p>

            <p>Cotys or Cotytto was a goddess worshiped by the Thracians, whose kings were
              frequently named from her. She was apparently identical with the Phrygian Cybele<note
                place="bottom">Strabo, x. 3.</note>. Her worship was introduced at Athens and at
              Corinth, where it was celebrated <hi rend="i">in private</hi> with great indecency and
                licentiousness<note place="bottom">See Buttmann, Mytholog. ii. 159. <hi rend="i"

            <p>Bendis, another Thracian goddess, had some analogy with Artemis and Hecate<note

              adopted at Athens ; her temple named the Bendideion was in the Peiræeus<note

            <p>The Ephesian Artemis was another Asiatic goddess whose worship was adopted by the
              Greeks. From their confounding her with their own Artemis, it would seem that they
              regarded her as the Moon-goddess ; though her attributes might lead to an
              identification of her with Cybele<note place="bottom">See Müller, Dor. i.
              403.</note>.</p>
            <p>The most ancient statue of the Artemis of Ephesus was a black stone which had fallen
              from heaven, — an aërolite of course. Her subsequent ones were a sort of Pantheôn, a
              compound of various attributes. She is covered with breasts and with the heads of
              animals, and stands an image either of the natural fecundity of the earth, or of that
              supposed to be induced by the influence of the moon.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be clearer than that this goddess was originally distinct from the
              Artemis of the Greeks. Yet in after times we find them so completely identified, that
              the Ephesians in the reign of Tiberius maintained<note place="bottom">Tacitus, Ann.
                iii. 61. See also Strabo, xiv. 1.</note> , “that Apollo and Diana were not born in
              Delos, as was commonly supposed ; but that the river Cenchrius and the grove Ortygia,
              where the travailing Latona, resting against an olive-tree which still existed,
              brought forth these deities, were with them.” In like manner the people of Tegyra in
              Bœotia appropriated to themselves the birth of Apollo, calling a hill near his temple
              Delos, and two springs Palm and Olive ; they also took to themselves the Delphian
              legends of Tityos and Pythôn<note place="bottom">Plut. Pelop. 16.</note>. We even find
              the whole mythic cycle of Leto, Apollo, and Artemis, transferred to Egypt, — Leto

            <p>Isis was one of the chief deities of Egypt and spouse of Osiris. Her worship was
              introduced during the Alexandrian period into Greece, and afterwards into Rome. The
              Isiac <pb n="227" xml:id="p227"/>mysteries were among the <hi rend="i">secret</hi>
              ones, and abounded in gross superstition, vile juggling, and scandalous indecency. As

                14. Elsewhere he says (i. 11.) that Osiris and Isis were Sun and Moon. Isis was also
                as the goddess of Saïs identified with Athena. Plut. de Is. et Os. 9.</note>
              identified with the Grecian Demeter, we are to suppose that she was one of those
              personifications of nature, or of the productive power of the earth, which we find
              among most ancient nations.</p>

              perhaps collect, that the Greeks, particularly the Cretans, used in those times to
              make piratical incursions on Egypt. Hesiod<note place="bottom">Theog. 338.</note>
              names the Nile.</p>
            <p>“Homer’s Egypt,” says Zoega<note place="bottom">Völck. Hom. Geog. 129.</note>, “seems
              to me altogether fabulous ; it presents nothing local, nothing characteristic. His
              Egyptians are Greeks, the presents which they give to Menelaos are such as a Greek
              would have given. Egyptian antiquity knows nothing of tripods. The poet had merely
              picked up some obscure reports of a rich city, Thebes, an island, Pharos, and that the
              Egyptians were good physicians, and used a kind of opium. The historic circumstances
              of the voyage of Menelaos, his adventures there, etc. are fictions. From this point of
              view many difficulties are removed, and many fine systems fall to pieces. The land of
              Egypt no longer increases in extent a whole day’s journey toward the north, Memphis is
              no longer founded after the destruction of Troy. The more ancient Greeks named the
              Delta Egypt, the rest Thebes, for which reason Memphis might very well be the Thebes
              of Homer. This poet had no knowledge of the true site of Thebes.”</p>
            <p>From Herodotus<note place="bottom">Herod. ii. 152. 153. The historian asserts
                positively, that previous to this time the Greeks knew nothing certain about
                Egypt.</note> we learn, that when (Ol. 27.) the Egyptian prince Psammitichos was
              driven by his competitors for the throne to seek shelter in the marshes of the Delta,
              he was told by the oracle of Buto that brazen men from the sea would <pb n="228"
                xml:id="p228"/>be his avengers. Shortly afterwards some Carians and Ionians, who
              were out a-pirating, were driven by stress of weather to Egypt, where they landed and
              began to plunder the country. As, after the Grecian fashion, they wore brass armour (a
              sight unusual to the Egyptians<note place="bottom">Yet in the Odyssey (xiv. 268 ;
                xvii. 437.) the Egyptians are armed in brass.</note> ), word was brought to
              Psammitichos that brazen men had landed and were plundering. Calling to mind the
              oracle, he sent to invite them to enter his service : they consented, and with their
              aid he made himself master of Egypt. He assigned them a settlement near the Pelusiac
              mouth of the Nile, whence their descendants were about eighty years afterwards removed
              to Memphis by Amasis to serve as his guards<note place="bottom">Herod. ii.
              154.</note>. This monarch appointed the town named Naucratis, which he allowed the
              Greeks to build on the Canobic arm of the Nile, to be the emporium of the trade of
              Greece and Egypt, just as Canton is that of the trade between China and Europe.
              Vessels were allowed to enter that port alone ; and if driven into any other by stress
              of weather, they were obliged to sail for it, or their cargoes, if the wind was still
              rough, were conveyed thither in barges round the Delta. Amasis, who was a great
              favourer of the Greeks, permitted them to erect altars and consecrate pieces of land
                (<hi rend="i">τϵμένα</hi>) to their national deities. These religious colonies
              extended far up the country, and we even find the Samians in one of the Oases<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> iii. 26.</note>.</p>
            <p>When the Ionians and Carians settled in Egypt, Psammitichos put some Egyptian
              children under their care, to be instructed in the Greek language ; and, as everything
              in that country was regulated on the principle of castes, these and their descendants
              formed the caste of Interpreters, whom Herodotus found there <hi rend="i">two
                centuries</hi> afterwards<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> ii. 154.</note>.
              We may thus see at once how in a space of two hundred years, by means of these
              interpreters, and of the introduction of the worship of the Grecian deities, the
              artful priesthood of Egypt may have contrived to frame the system above noticed, of
              the derivation of the religion and civilization of Greece from the land of Nile.</p>

              according to one of the Homerids he was the son of Hermes by an Arcadian nymph<note

              daughter of Dryops (<hi rend="i">Woody</hi>), abandoned Olympos and took service as a
              shepherd in Arcadia. He succeeded in gaining the heart of the ‘well-tressed nymph,’
              and a child was the result of their secret interviews. But so monstrous was his
              appearance, that the nurse on beholding him fled away in affright. Hermes immediately
              caught him up, wrapped him carefully in a hare-skin, and carried him away to Olympos :
              then taking his seat with Zeus and the other gods, he produced his babe. All the gods,
              especially Dionysos, were delighted with the little stranger ; and they named him Pan
              (i. e. <hi rend="i">All</hi>), because he had charmed them <hi rend="i">all.</hi></p>
            <p>Others fabled that Pan was the son of Hermes by Penelope, whose love he gained under

                divination<note place="bottom">Above, p. 123.</note>.</p>
            <pb n="230" xml:id="p230"/><p>The worship of Pan seems to have been confined to Arcadia
              till the time of the battle of Marathôn, when Pheidippides, the courier who was sent
              from Athens to Sparta to call on the Spartans for aid against the Persians, declared
              that, as he was passing by Mount Parthenion near Tegea in Arcadia, he heard the voice
              of Pan calling to him, and desiring him to ask the Athenians why they paid no regard
              to him, who was always, and still would be, friendly and assisting to them. After the
              battle the Athenians consecrated a cave to Pan under the Acropolis, and offered him

            <p>Long before this time the Grecian and Egyptian systems of religion had begun to

              the horned and goat-footed god of the Arcadian herdsmen<note place="bottom">Herod. ii.

              for exalting him. It is amusing to read how all the attributes of the Arcadian god
              were made to accord with this notion. “Pan,” says Servius<note place="bottom">On Virg.
                Buc. ii. 31. Sec also Sch. Theocr. i. 3. Eudocia, 323.</note>, “is a rustic god,

              >All</hi> : for he has horns in similitude of the rays of the sun and the horns of the
              moon : his face is ruddy, in imitation of the æther : he has a spotted fawn-skin on
              his breast, in likeness of the stars : his lower parts are shaggy, on account of the
              trees, shrubs, and wild-beasts : he has goat’s feet, to denote the stability of the
              earth : he has a pipe of seven reeds, on account of the harmony of the heaven, in
              which there are seven sounds : he has a crook, that is a curved staff, on account of
              the year, which runs back on itself, because he is the god of all nature. It is
              feigned by the poets, that he struggled with Love and was conquered by him, because,

              not gain the love of Syrinx, another of the nymphs. Syrinx was a Naïs of Nonacris in
              Arcadia, and devoted to the service of Artemis : as she was returning one day from the
              chase, and passed by Mount Lycæon, Pan beheld her and loved ; but when he would
              address her, she fled. The god pursued : she reached the river Ladôn, and unable to
              cross it implored the aid of her sister-nymphs ; and when Pan thought to grasp the
              object of his pursuit, he found his arms filled with reeds. While he stood sighing at
              his disappointment, the wind began to agitate the reeds, and produced a low musical
              sound. The god took the hint, cut seven of the reeds, and formed from them his <hi

              Boreas. The nymph favoured more the god of Arcadia, and the wind-god in a fit of
              jealousy blew her down from the summit of a lofty rock. A tree of her own name (<hi

            <p>What are called <hi rend="i">Panic terrors</hi> were ascribed to Pan ; for loud

              is supposed, from the employment usually assigned him by the Romans after they had

            <p>The Nymphs occur in various relations to gods and men. Their amours, of which we have
              seen some instances, were numerous. The charge of rearing various gods and heroes was
              committed to them : they were, for instance, the nurses of Dionysos, Pan, and even
              Zeus himself ; and they also brought up Aristæos and Æneias. They were moreover the
              attendants of the goddesses ; they waited on Hera and Aphrodite, and in
              huntress-attire pursued the deer over the mountains in the company of Artemis.</p>

            <p>A man, named Rhœcos, happening to see an oak just ready to fall to the ground,
              ordered his slaves to prop it up. The Nymph, who had been on the point of perishing
              with the tree, came to him and expressed her gratitude to him for having saved her
              life, and at the same time desired him to ask what reward he would. Rhœcos then
              requested her to permit him to be her lover, and the Nymph acceded to his desire. She
              at the same time charged him strictly to avoid the society of every other woman, and
              told him that a bee should be her messenger. One time the bee happened to come to
              Rhœcos as he was playing at draughts, and he made a rough reply. This so incensed the
              Nymph that she deprived him of sight.</p>
            <p>Similar was the fate of the Sicilian Daphnis. A Naïs loved him, and forbade him to
              hold intercourse with any other woman under pain of loss of sight. Long he abstained,
              though tempted by the fairest maids of Sicily. At length a princess contrived to
              intoxicate him : he broke his vow, and the threatened penalty was inflicted<note

              his pranks with the other nymphs, Echo, being of a very loquacious character, used to
              keep Hera in chat till the nymphs had time to make their escape. When Hera discovered
              the artifice, she declared by way of punishment, that in future she should have but
              little use of her tongue ; and immediately she lost all power of doing any more than

            <p>It was fabled, that in the early ages of Southern Italy, when the people there were
              in the pastoral state, the Epimelian- or Flock-nymphs were once seen dancing at a
              place called the Sacred Rocks in Messapia. The young shepherds quitted their flocks to
              gaze on them ; and, ignorant of their quality, declared that they could dance better
              themselves. The nymphs were offended, and after a long dispute the shepherds began to
              contend with them. The motions of the rustics were of <pb n="242" xml:id="p242"
              />course awkward and ungraceful, those of the nymphs light and elegant, as became
              goddesses. The former were vanquished ; and the nymphs cried out to them, “O youths,
              you have been contending with the Epimelian nymphs ! you shall therefore be punished.”
              The shepherds instantly became trees where they stood, at the temple of the nymphs ;
              and to this day, says Nicander, a voice as of lamentation is heard at night to issue
              from the grove. The place is called that of the Nymphs and the Youths<note

            <p>Dryops, the son of the river Spercheios, who dwelt at Mount Œta, had a daughter named
              Dryope. She fed the flocks of her father, and the Hamadryades conceived a strong
              affection for her. They made her their playfellow, and taught her to dance and sing
              hymns to the gods. Apollo beheld her dancing with them, and fell in love with her. He
              changed himself into a tortoise, with which they began to play and amuse themselves.
              Dryope placing it in her bosom, the god changed himself into a serpent : the nymphs
              fled in affright, and he gained his object. Dryope returned home, and shortly
              afterwards married Andræmôn the son of Mylos. Her son by Apollo was named Amphissos,
              who founded at the foot of Œta a town of the same name, and ruled over the whole of
              that part of the country. He built a temple to Apollo ; at which when Dryope appeared
              one day, the Hamadryades carried her away and concealed her in the wood. In her stead
              they caused a poplar to grow up, and a spring of water to gush out beside it. The
              nymphs communicated their own nature to Dryope ; and her son Amphissos out of
              gratitude raised them a temple, and instituted games, at which no woman was permitted
              to be present ; because when Dryope was taken away, two maidens who were present
              informed the people of it, and the nymphs incensed turned them both into
                fir-trees<note place="bottom">Nicander, <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Ant. Lib. 32. Ovid,

            <p>Terambos, who dwelt at the foot of Mount Othrys, abounded in flocks, which he himself
              fed on the mountains. The nymphs assisted him, for they were charmed with his singing
              and his music, in which he excelled all the men of his time, <pb n="243" xml:id="p243"
              />being the inventor of the lyre and the shepherd’s pipe, and they often danced to his
              melody. Pan also loved him, and one time warned him to drive his flocks down into the
              plain, as a most terrific winter was coming on : but Terambos, elate with youth and
              confidence, despised the admonition of the friendly deity, and even mocked at and
              ridiculed the gentle amiable nymphs, saying that they were not the children of Zeus at
              all, but of Deino daughter of the Spercheios, and that Poseidôn had once when in love
              with one of them turned the rest into poplars, and kept them in that form as long as
              he thought proper. Soon however the presage of Pan proved true : the winter came on ;
              all the streams and torrents were frozen, the snow fell in great quantities, and the
              flocks of Terambos vanished along with the paths and the trees. The nymphs then
              changed Terambos himself into the animal called by the Thessalians <hi rend="i"

            <p>Nereus, though not mentioned by name in Homer, is frequently alluded to under the

              knowledge and his love of truth and justice, whence he was termed an <hi rend="i"
                >elder</hi> : the gift of prophecy was also assigned him. When Heracles was in quest
              of the apples of the Hesperides, he was directed by the nymphs to Nereus : he found
              the god asleep, and seized him. Nereus on awaking changed himself into a variety of
              forms, but in vain : he was obliged to instruct him how to proceed before the hero
              would release him<note place="bottom">Apollod. ii. 5.</note>. He also foretold to
              Paris, when he was carrying away Helena, the evils he would bring on his country and
                family<note place="bottom">Hor. Carm. i. 15. from Alcæus.</note>.</p>
            <p>Nereus was married to Doris, one of the Ocean-nymphs, and by her he had the nymphs
              named Nereïdes<note place="bottom">Hermann (Opusc. ii. 178.) renders Nereus <hi

            <head>Ν<hi rend="i">ηρηΐδϵς. Nereïdes.</hi></head>
            <p>The Nereïdes, or nymphs of the sea, were fifty in number ; but the mythologists do
              not agree exactly in the names which they put into the catalogue. The best known of
              them are, Amphitrite the wife of Poseidôn, Thetis the mother of Achilleus, and
              Galateia, who was loved by the Cyclôps Polyphemos.</p>
            <p>The Nereïdes, like all the other female deities, were originally conceived to be of a
              beautiful form, with skin of a delicate whiteness and long flowing hair. A constant
              epithet of Thetis is <hi rend="i">silver-footed</hi> (<hi rend="i">ἀργυροπέξα</hi>) ;
              and it was for venturing to compare herself in beauty with the Nereïdes, that Cassiope
              brought such misfortune on her daughter Andromeda. But the painters and sculptors, who
              contributed so much to degrade the other gods, robbed the <hi rend="i">sea-nymphs</hi>
              also of their charms, by bestowing on them green hair, and turning their lower parts
              into those of a fish ; thus giving them a form exactly corresponding with the modern
              idea of a mermaid.</p>
            <p>The individual names of the Nereïdes are significatory of the qualities and phænomena
              of the sea.</p>

            <p>According to Hesiod<note place="bottom">Theog. 930.</note>, Tritôn was a son of
              Poseidôn and Amphitrite, who, ‘keeping to the bottom of the sea, dwelt with his mother
              and royal father in a golden house.’ Later <pb n="246" xml:id="p246"/>poets made him
              his father’s trumpeter. He was also multiplied, and we read of Tritons in the plural
              number.</p>
            <p>Like the Nereïdes, the Tritons were degraded to the fishform. Pausanias<note
                place="bottom">Paus. ix. 20. 21.</note> tells us that the women of Tanagra in
              Bœotia, going into the sea to purify themselves for the orgies of Bacchos, were, while
              there, assailed by Tritôn ; but on praying to their god, he vanquished their
              persecutor. Others, he adds, said that Tritôn used to carry off the cattle which were
              driven down to the sea, and to seize all small vessels ; till the Tanagrians placing
              bowls of wine on the shore, he drank of them, and becoming intoxicated threw himself
              down on the shore to sleep ; where as he lay, a Tanagrian cut off his head with an
              axe. He relates these legends to account for the statue of Tritôn at Tanagra being
              headless. He then subjoins, — </p>
            <p>“I have seen another Tritôn among the curiosities of the Romans, but it is not so
              large as this of the Tanagrians. The form of the Tritons is this : — the hair of their
              head resembles the parsley that grows in marshes, both in colour and in the perfect
              likeness of one hair to another, so that no difference can be perceived among them :
              the rest of their body is rough with small scales, and is of about the same hardness
              as the skin of a fish : they have fish-gills under their ears : their nostrils are
              those of a man, but their teeth are broader, and like those of a wild beast : their
              eyes seem to me azure ; and their hands, fingers and nails are of the form of the
              shells of shell-fish : they have, instead of feet, fins under their breast and belly,
              like those of the porpoise.”</p>

            <head>Π<hi rend="i">ρωτεύς. Proteus.</hi></head>
            <p>In the fourth book of the Odyssey Homer introduces this sea-god. He styles him, like
              Nereus and Phorcys, a <hi rend="i">Seaelder</hi><note place="bottom">Od. iv.
                384.</note>, and gives him the power of foretelling the future<note place="bottom"
                  ><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> v. 561. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. He calls him
              Egyptian, and the servant of Poseidôn<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi>
                v. 385.</note>, and says that his task was keeping the seals or sea-calves<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> v. 411.</note>. When Menelaos was wind-bound at
              the island of Pharos, opposite <pb n="247" xml:id="p247"/>Egypt, and he and his crew
              were suffering from want of food, Eidothea the daughter of Proteus accosted him, and
              bringing seal-skins directed him to disguise himself and three of his companions in
              them ; and when Proteus at noon should come up out of the sea and go to sleep amidst
              his herds, to seize and hold him till he disclosed some means of relief from his
              present distress.</p>
            <p>Menelaos obeys the nymph ; and Proteus drives up and counts his herds, and then lies
              down to rest. The hero immediately seizes him, and the god turns himself into a lion,
              a serpent, a pard, a boar, water, and a tree. At length, finding he cannot escape, he
              resumes his own form, and reveals to Menelaos the remedy for his distress. He at the
              same time informs him of the situation of his friends, and particularly notices his
              having seen Odysseus in the island of Calypso, — a clear proof that his own abode was
              not confined to the coast of Egypt.</p>
            <p>This part of the Odyssey has been beautifully imitated by Virgil in the fourth book
              of his Georgics, where Aristæos on the loss of his bees seeks in a similar way a
              remedy from Proteus. The scene is here transferred to the peninsula of Pallene, and
              the god is described as of a blue colour, the hue which painters had been pleased to
              bestow on the marine deities : he has also a chariot drawn by the biped
              sea-horses.</p>
            <p>Homer does not name the parents of this marine deity, and there is no mention of him
              in the Theogony. Apollodorus makes him a son of Poseidôn<note place="bottom">Apollod.

            <p>Those who embraced the theory of representing the gods as having been originally mere
              men, said that Proteus was a king of Egypt ; and the Egyptian priests told how he
              detained Helena when Paris was driven to Egypt, and gave him an image or phantom in
              her stead, and then restored her to Menelaos<note place="bottom">Below, Part II. chap.

            <p>The name of this deity, signifying <hi rend="i">First</hi> (<hi rend="i">πρὸ,

              They regarded him as a <pb n="248" xml:id="p248"/>symbol of the original matter which
              developed itself into the four elements whose form he took : the lion was æther, the

            <p>Glaucos, as is evident from his name, was an original god of the sea, probably only
              another form of Poseidôn, whose son he is in some accounts<note place="bottom"
                >Euanthes <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Athen. vii. 296.</note>. Like the marine gods in

              telling them what had happened, or what was to happen. In later times sailors were
              continually making reports of his soothsaying<note place="bottom">Paus. ix. 22,
                7.</note>. Some said he dwelt with the Nereïdes at Delos, where he gave responses to

                  rend="i">ut supra.</hi></note> ; according to others, he visited each year all the

              unseen foretold in the Æolic dialect all kinds of evil. The fishermen watched for his
              approach, and endeavoured by fastings, prayer and fumigations to avert the ruin with
              which his prophecy menaced the fruits and cattle. At times he was seen among the
              waves, and his body appeared covered with muscles, sea weed and stones. He was heard
              evermore to lament his fate in not being able to die<note place="bottom">Plat. Rep. x.

            <p>This last circumstance refers to the common pragmatic history of Glaucos. He was a

              one day the fish which he had caught and thrown on the grass to bite it, and then to
              jump into the sea, his curiosity excited him to taste it also ; immediately on his

              compassion made her a goddess of the sea under the name of Leucothea, and him a god
              under that of Palæmôn. Both were held powerful to save from shipwreck, and were
              invoked by sailors. The fable appears to be ancient ; as Leucothea, who gives her veil
              to Odysseus when tossed in a storm, is called ‘fair-ankled Ino, daughter of Cadmos,’
              and her transformation is mentioned<note place="bottom">Od. v. 333. Nitzsch <hi

                if Homer was acquainted with the story of Perseus : the passage in which he is
                mentioned (Il. xiv. 519.) is, we think, justly regarded as an interpolation. Völcker
                (Myth. Geog. 15.) refers to II. xix. 116. 125 ; but that passage, besides its being
                in one of the later books, is liable to objection. See Heyne and Payne Knight <hi
                  rend="i">in loc.</hi></note>. Along with the Grææ, according to the Theogony<note
                place="bottom">Theog. 274. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>, Keto bore to Phorcys the
              Gorgons, ‘who dwelt beyond the bright Ocean in the extremity toward night, where the
              clear-voiced Hesperides abide.’ It names them Stheino, Euryale and Medusa, which last
              alone was mortal. Poseidôn, it is added, lay with her in a ‘soft mead amid the
              spring-flowers,’ and when her head was cut off by Perseus, the ‘great’ Chrysaôr (<hi
                rend="i">Gold-sword</hi>) and the steed Pegasos (<hi rend="i">Fount-horse</hi>)
              sprang forth. Æschylus calls the Gor-gons the ‘three sisters of the Grææ, winged,
              serpent-fleeced, hateful to man, whom no one can look on and retain his breath<note
                place="bottom">Prom. 804. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.’ They were also represented
              as winged on the ancient coffer of Kypselos at Olympia<note place="bottom">Paus. v.

                place="bottom">Hesiod, Shield, 233.</note>. Others describe them as having their
              heads environed with scaly snakes, and with huge teeth like those of swine, brazen
              hands and golden wings. Their looks, it is added, turned all who beheld them to
                stone<note place="bottom">Apollod. ii. 4. 2. Tzetz. Lyc. 838. Sch. Æsch. Prom. <hi

            <p>The Gorgons and the Grææ are always mentioned together, and they seem to have been
              appropriated to the mythe of Perseus. We might therefore suppose them to have been a
              pure poetic fiction, were it not that, as we shall show, the Gorgon in that mythe,
              Medusa, is merely another form of Pallas-Athene. It is therefore not improbable that
              the theory of some mythologists of the present day may be the true one ; namely, that
              the <hi rend="i">two</hi> Gorgons and <hi rend="i">two</hi> Grææ are <pb n="254"
                xml:id="p254"/>only personifications of the terrors of the sea, the former denoting

              belonged to the Sea (<hi rend="i">Pontos</hi>), whose grandchildren they are, and not
              to the calm soft-flowing Ocean, whither they were transported when they had ceased to
              be regarded as personifications, and had been introduced into the mythe of Perseus. As
              in this mythe Medusa (<hi rend="i">Mistress</hi>) — whose name is of a nature totally
              different from theirs — was added to the Gorgons, the principle of uniformity probably
              led to a similar increase of the Grææ.</p>
            <p>All these beings are, we think, placed by the Theogony in Oceanic isles ; they may
              however have dwelt on the opposite coast, though we believe few who are well versed in
              the cosmology of those times will assign them that gloomy region ; most certainly they
              are not on this side of Ocean. Hither, however, they were all removed in the course of
              time, and even to the Syrtes and Cyrene<note place="bottom">There seems to us to be

              places them somewhere in Libya. This however is not to be wondered at, for it is only
              a part of the system of localisation, which assigned a definite abode in well-known
              countries to all the beings of fable, which brought for example the transoceanic

            <p>Zephyros (Ζ<hi rend="i">έϕυρς</hi>) is described by Homer as a strong-blowing wind,

          <p rend="noindent"><hi rend="sc">The</hi> romantic geography of the most romantic poem of
            Greece, the Homeric Odyssey, is now to occupy our attention. Its poet is in our eyes a
            Grecian Ariosto, and we should as soon hope to discover the true position of the isle of
            Alcina as of those of Circe and Calypso. The moment he conducts his hero away from
            Greece, he engages him in magic regions amidst ogres, fairies, and monsters of various
            kinds, as numerous as ever were encountered by the knights of Gothic romance. To form
            these he took possession of the cosmogonie Cyclopes and Giants and transformed them ; he
            adopted the tales of Phœnician mariners, and he transferred the wonders of other mythic
            cycles to the West-sea, which he made the scene of his hero's adventures.</p>
          <p>It is a question among critics whether the Odyssey is or is not the work of one mind,
            whether the domestic scenes in Ithaca, and the wondrous adventures related to Alcinoös,
            are parts of one continuous preconceived narrative. Into this interesting subject we are
            not required at present to enter, for the geography of these parts is distinct, the one
            lying in the domains of romance, the other confining itself to the sober realms of the
            actual earth. We shall first direct our attention to the latter<note place="bottom">On
              the Homeric geography the best work by far is that of Völcker, so frequently alluded
              to in these pages. The ‘Ælteste Weltkunde’ of Voss has two great defects ; he <hi
                rend="i">will</hi> localise every place and people, and he is resolute in
              maintaining the two poems to be the produce of one mind, and denies all

          <p>In the Ilias the only places noticed out of Greece to the <pb n="258" xml:id="p258"
            />west are the isles over which Odysseus ruled. The Odyssey would seem to intimate a
            knowledge of Italy and Sicily ; for a place named Temesa, whither the Taphians used to
            sail to barter iron for copper, is mentioned<note place="bottom">Od. i. 183.</note> ;
            and in Italy, in ancient times a most cypriferous region, there was a place named
            Temesa, or rather Tempsa<note place="bottom">Strabo. vi. 1. Mela. ii. 4. Ovid, Met. xv.
              52. 707.</note>. The people of this place are said to speak a language different from

                >in loc.</hi></note>, and this circumstance also would accord well with Italy. But
            on the other hand the Greeks, when they began to plant colonies in Italy and Sicily, got
            the habit of localising all the names of peoples and places in the romantic fictions of
            their <hi rend="i">aœdi</hi> ; and further, Tempsa lies on the west side of Italy, and
            there was also a place named Taminos in the isle, which bestowed its appellation on the
            metal it yielded — Cyprus<note place="bottom">The majority of the critics (Nitzsch, <hi

            from Temesa. But it may be said that the Sikelans, who dwelt in Italy and Sicily, are

            have chosen to regard all westwards of Greece as one wide sea, in which he was at
            liberty to place what isles he pleased, and people them as his fancy prompted. On this
            principle we now will trace the wanderings of Odysseus, the Sindbad of Greece<note

            <p>Odysseus, when doubling the Cape of Malea in Laconia on his return from Troy<note
                place="bottom">Od. ix. 80.</note>, encountered a violent north-east wind (<hi
                rend="i">βορέης</hi>), which drove him for nine days along the sea, till he reached
              the country of the Lotus-eaters. Here, after watering, he sent three of his men to
              discover who the inhabitants were. These men on coming among the Lotus-eaters were
              kindly entertained by them, and given some of their own food, the Lotus-plant, to eat.
              The effect of this plant was such, that those who tasted of it lost all thoughts of
              home, and wished to remain in that country. It was by main force that Odysseus dragged
              these men away, and he was even obliged to tie them under the benches of his ship.</p>
            <p>As the coast of Cyrene lies opposite the Peloponnese, and is much nearer to it than
              Egypt is to Crete, we must suppose the country of the Lotus-eaters to have been far
              more to the west. They seem in the poet’s view to have been the last tribe of ordinary
              men in that direction, and to have dwelt on the verge of the land of fable. The Lotus,
              under the name of Jujuba, is, we may observe, a part of the food of the people of the
              north coast of Africa at the present day.</p>

                Odyssee, pp. 110, 111. Völcker, Hom. Geog. 111.</note>, and came to that of the
              Cyclopes, which could not have been very far distant, or the poet would in that case,
              as he always does, have specified the number of days occupied in the voyage. The
              Cyclopes are described as a rude lawless race, who neither planted nor sowed, but
              whose land was so fertile as spontaneously to produce them wheat, barley, and vines.
              They had no social <pb n="260" xml:id="p260"/>institutions, neither assemblies nor
              laws, but dwelt separately, each in his cave, on the tops of lofty mountains, and each
              without regard to others governed his own wife and children.</p>
            <p>In front of a harbour of their land lay a well-wooded fertile isle, abundantly
              stocked with goats. But the Cyclopes, having no ships, could not derive any advantage
              from it. Odysseus, leaving the rest of his fleet at the island, went with one ship to
              the country of the Cyclopes. Here he entered the cave of the Cyclôps Polyphemos, who
              was a son of Poseidôn by the nymph Thoösa, the daughter of Phorcys. The Cyclôps on his
              return in the evening with his flocks, finding strangers there, inquired who they
              were ; and on Odysseus saying that they had been shipwrecked, and appealing to his
              mercy and reverence for the gods, he declared that the Cyclopes regarded not the gods,
              for they were much more powerful than they : he then seized two of the Greeks, and
              dashing them to the ground like young whelps killed and devoured them. When he fell
              asleep Odysseus was going to kill him, till recollecting the huge rock, — one which
              the teams of two-and-twenty fourwheeled waggons could not move, — with which he had
              closed the door, he refrained. Against the next evening Odysseus had prepared a piece
              of the Cyclôps’ own olive-staff, which was as large as the mast of a merchant-vessel ;
              and when the monster had devoured two more of his victims gave him wine to drink, and
              then while he was sleeping profoundly, heated the stick in the fire, and aided by four
              of his companions bored out his eye with it. Polyphemos roaring out with pain, the
              other Cyclopes came to inquire what had befallen him ; but on his informing them that
                <hi rend="i">Nobody</hi> (Ο<hi rend="i">ὔτις</hi>) — the name which Odysseus had
              given himself — was killing him, thinking it was some disease they left him,
              recommending him to pray to his father. Next morning, when Polyphemos turned out his
              sheep and goats, his prisoners fastened themselves under their bellies, and so
              escaped. Odysseus, when a little way out at sea called out his real name, and the
              Cyclôps hurled immense rocks at him, which were near sinking his ship.</p>
            <p>Nothing is said by the poet respecting the size of the <pb n="261" xml:id="p261"
              />Cyclopes in general, but every effort is made to give an exaggerated idea of that of
              Polyphemos. When Odysseus first sees him, he compares him to ‘a woody peak of lofty
              mountains, when it appears separate from others.’ The crash of the bundle of wood
              which he brings home in the evening, when it is cast on the ground, terrifies the
              Greeks who were hiding in his cave : the teams of twenty-two waggons could not move
              the rock with which he closed his door : his staff was in length and thickness equal
              to the mast of a large ship : the first rock which he flings at the ship of Odysseus
              was ‘the top of a great hill,’ and falling before the vessel it drove her back to the
              shore ; the second was still larger.</p>
            <p>Yet, possibly, we are not to infer that the Cyclopes were in general of such huge
              dimensions or cannibal habits. Polyphemos was not of the ordinary Cyclôps-race, being
              the son of Poseidôn and a sea-nymph : he is also said<note place="bottom">Od. i.
                70.</note> to have been the strongest of the Cyclopes. It is not a little
              remarkable, that neither in the description of the Cyclopes in general, nor of
              Polyphemos in particular, is there any notice taken of their being one-eyed ; yet in
              the account of the blinding of the latter, it seems to be assumed as a thing well
              known. We may hence perhaps infer that Homer followed the usual derivation of the
                name<note place="bottom">See above, p. 46.</note>.</p>
            <p>Both ancients and moderns agree in regarding Sicily as the country of the
                Cyclopes<note place="bottom">Strabo, i. 2. Völcker, H. G. 110. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi> This critic places the Cyclopes and the other fabulous tribes which we
                shall meet with on the west coast of Sicily.</note> : we however cannot help
              thinking that it was on the coast of Libya. It lay at no great distance from that of
              the Lotus-eaters, which was evidently on that coast. The poet merely says, ‘We then
              sail on further, and come to the land of the Cyclopes ;’ and if it had been an island,
              he would, as usual, have noticed the circumstance : he would also have told us with
              what wind they sailed to it, if it had been at anything like the distance which Sicily
              is from Libya : and further, though the fertility of Sicily may accord with that of
              the Cyclopes’ land, yet it does not offer the caverns on mountain-tops in which they
              abode, nor can any island answering to that of the Odyssey, stretching before a
              harbour, <pb n="262" xml:id="p262"/>be shown in it. If the little islet of Ortygia in
              front of Syracuse should be thought of, we reply, that it in no point accords with the
              description in the poem.</p>
            <p>It is thus that the Thunder, Lightning, and Flame of the Theogony became one-eyed
              giants in the hands of our poet. When they had been localised in the neighbourhood of
              volcanoes it was a simple process to convert them into smiths, the assistants of
                Hephæstos<note place="bottom">Callim. iii. 46. Virg. Geor. iv. 173. Æn. viii. 416.
                  <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. As they were now artists in one line, it gave no
              surprise to find them engaged in a task adapted to their huge strength, namely that of
              rearing the massive walls of Tiryns, thence named Cyclopian, for which purpose they

              was by Poseidôn mother of the king of the Phæacians, a people of the ordinary

            <p>It was probably the poet’s saying that they were destroyed by the gods (though the

              the hero Heracles the gods subdued their formidable foes. The principal champions on
              the side of the Giants were Porphyriôn, Alcyoneus and Encelados, on the last of whom

              his eyes ; he hurled glowing rocks with loud cries and hissing against heaven, and
              flame and storm rushed from his mouth. The gods in dismay fled to Egypt, and concealed
              themselves under the forms of various animals. Zeus however, after a severe conflict,

            <p>After their escape from the Cyclôps, Odysseus and his companions sailed <hi rend="i"

              entirely surrounded by a wall of brass and by smooth precipitous rocks : and here
              Æolos dwelt in continual <pb n="264" xml:id="p264"/>joy and festivity, with his wife
              and his six sons and as many daughters, whom, after the fashion set by Zeus, he had
              married to each other. The isle had no other tenants. The office of directing and
              ruling the winds had been conferred on Æolos by Zeus ; and when he was dismissing
              Odysseus, after having hospitably entertained him for an entire month, he gave him all
              the winds but Zephyros tied up in a bag of ox-hide. For nine days and nights the ships
              ran merrily before the wind : on the tenth they were within sight of Ithaca ; when
              Odysseus, who had hitherto held the helm himself, fell asleep : his comrades, who
              fancied that Æolos had given him treasure in the bag, opened it : the winds rushed
              out, and hurried them back to Æolia. Judging from what had befallen them that they
              were hated by the gods, the director of the winds drove them with reproaches from his
              isle.</p>
            <p>As Æolia was a <hi rend="i">floating isle</hi>, it is evidently as needless to look

              time when Odysseus came to it, it must have been lying near the country of the
              Cyclopes ; but we are not told whether it remained immovable during the month that he
              spent in it, or the time that elapsed between his departure and return. The Latin
              poets, following the later Greeks, have placed Æolos in the Liparæan islands<note

            <p>The country of the Læstrygonians lay very far to the west. Odysseus, when driven from
              his isleby Æolos, sailed <hi rend="i">on further</hi> for six days and nights, at the
              end of which time he reached the land of the Læstrygonians ; and the distance thence
              to the isle of Ææa, which we shall show to be near the extremity of the Sea, could not
              have been considerable, as the length of time consumed in the passage thither is not
              specified.</p>
            <p>The Læstrygonians are another of those huge androphagous races, whom the invention of
              the poet has placed on the coast of Libya. Unlike the Cyclopes, they lived in the
              social state ; <pb n="265" xml:id="p265"/>their king was named Antiphates, their town
              Læstrygonia or Telepylos (it is uncertain which), and the fountain near it Artakia.
              There was a port at a little distance from the city, which all the ships of Odysseus,
              but the one he was himself on board of, entered. A herald with two others were then
              sent to the city : they met the daughter of Antiphates at the fount Artakia, and were
              by her directed to her father’s house. On entering it they were terrified at the sight
              of his wife, who was ‘as large as the top of a mountain.’ She instantly called her
              husband from the market-place, who seized one of them and killed and dressed him for
              dinner. The other two made their escape, pursued by the Læstrygonians, who with huge
              rocks destroyed all the ships and their crews which were within the harbour, — that of
              Odysseus, which had not entered, alone escaping.</p>
            <p>When describing the country of the Læstrygonians, the poet says<note place="bottom"

              but, as Völcker justly observes, there was nothing so remarkable in this practice as
              to induce the poet to place it among the wonders of the West. It is much more probable
              that the solution of the difficulty will be found in the notion, presently to be
              noticed, of the abode of the Sun and Dawn being in the West, which may have engendered
              a belief that at the western extremity of the earth the night was of extremely short

            <p>When Odysseus and his surviving companions had escaped from the Læstrygonians, they
                <hi rend="i">sailed on</hi>, that is still westwards, till they came to the isle of
                Ææa<note place="bottom">Though we say Ææa, Æolia, Thrinakia, and Ogygia, they are
                all adjectives, as <hi rend="i">ν</hi>[ATTcaratere]<hi rend="i">σος</hi> is always
                joined with them.</note>, the abode of Circe. This isle may be regarded as the most
              westerly of those scattered by the poet over the Mediterranean, for it appears to have
              lain on the very edge of the Ocean-stream ; and all the other isles and coasts
              mentioned in the poem, except Ogygia the isle of Calypso, lie manifestly between it
              and Greece.</p>
            <p>Circe is one of those deities whom Homer calls <hi rend="i">human-speaking</hi> (<hi
                rend="i">αὐδήϵσσαι</hi>), and who do not seem to have possessed the power of moving
              through the air or along the water, but dwelt continually in one place. She is said by
                him<note place="bottom">Od. x. 135.</note> to be the daughter of Helios by the
              Oceanis Persa, and own sister of the <hi rend="i">wise</hi> (<hi rend="i">ὀ</hi>λ<hi

                Ilias to the serpent, the boar, and the lion, and signifies <hi rend="i">grim.</hi>
                In the Odyssey it is an epithet of Atlas, Minôs and Æætes, and its most appropriate
                sense is <hi rend="i">wise.</hi> Passow, <hi rend="i">s. v.</hi> Nitzsch.</note>
              Æætes.</p>
            <p>The island of Circe was small ; her abode was in the centre of it, deeply embosomed
              in wood. She dwelt alone, attended by four nymphs ; and all persons who approached her
              dwelling were turned by her magic art into swine. When the comrades of Odysseus, whom
              he sent to explore her residence, had tasted of the drugged draught which she set
              before them, <pb n="267" xml:id="p267"/>she struck them with her wand, and immediately
              they underwent the usual change. But when Odysseus himself, hearing of their
              misfortune, set out to release them or share their fate, he was met by Hermes, who
              gave him a plant named <hi rend="i">Moly</hi>, potent against her magic, and directed
              him how to act. Accordingly when she reached him the medicated bowl he drank of it
              freely, and Circe thinking it had produced its usual effect, striking him with her
              wand bade him go join his comrades in their sty. But Odysseus drawing his sword
              threatened to slay her ; and the terrified goddess bound herself by a solemn oath to
              do him no injury. She afterwards at his desire restored his companions to their
              pristine form, and they all abode in her dwelling for an entire year.</p>
            <p>At the end of that period they were anxious to depart, but the goddess told the hero
              that he must previously cross the Ocean, and enter the abode of Aïdes, to consult the
              blind prophet Teiresias. Accordingly they left Ææa rather late in the day, as it would
              appear, and impelled by a favouring north wind their ship reached by sunset the
              opposite coast of Ocean, the land of perpetual gloom. Odysseus obeyed the directions
              of the goddess in digging a small pit, into which he poured mulse, wine, water, flour,
              and the blood of the victims. The dead came trooping out of the house of Aïdes, and
              Odysseus there saw the heroines of former days, and conversed with the shades of
              Agamemnôn and Achilleus. Terror at length came over him ; he hastened back to his
              ship ; the stream carried it along, and they reached Ææa while it was yet night.</p>
            <p>We have here a proof that the course of the Ocean was northwards ; the north-wind
                (<hi rend="i">βορέας</hi>) is required to carry them over (the House of Aïdes lying
              probably south-west of Ææa), and the current and the breeze of its surface bring them
              back. It would also appear that, as soon as the ship left the Ocean and entered the
              Sea, it was at Ææa.</p>
            <p>Circe is said to have had by Odysseus a son named Telegonos <hi rend="i"
                >(Far-born)</hi>, who, as we shall see, unwittingly slew his own father. The
                Theogony<note place="bottom">Theog. 1011.</note> gives them for offspring Agrios and
              Latinos, ‘who afar in the recess of the holy isles ruled <pb n="268" xml:id="p268"
              />over all the renowned Tyrsenians.’ Hesiod said elsewhere<note place="bottom">Sch.
                Apoll. Rh. iii. 311.</note> that Helios had brought Circe in his chariot to her isle
              off the coast of Tyrrhenia.</p>
            <p>It is curious to observe the liberties which the later writers allowed themselves to
              take with the narratives of Homer and Hesiod. These poets expressly say that Æætes and
              Circe were brother and sister, and children of the Sun, yet Dionysius the cyclographer
              makes Circe the daughter of Æætes by Hecate, the daughter of his brother Perses. This
              pragmatiser goes on to say that she was married to the king of the Sarmatians, whom
              she poisoned, and seized his kingdom ; but governing tyrannically she was expelled,
              and then fled to a desert isle of the Ocean, or as some said to the headland named
              from her in Italy<note place="bottom">Diodor. iv. 45. Eudocia, 261. Sch. Apoll. Rh.
                iii. 200.</note> ; for in the localisation of the imaginary isles and regions
              visited by Odysseus, the promontory of Circæum on the coast of Latium was fixed on for
              the abode of Circe. The fact of its not being an island offered no difficulty, as it
              was asserted that it once had been surrounded with water to a great extent<note
                place="bottom">Plin. Hist. Nat. iii. 5. Serv. Æn. iii. 386. Comp. Apoll. Rh. iv.
                659. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>The Latin poets thence took occasion to connect Circe with their own scanty
              mythology. It was fabled, for example, that she had been married to king Picus, whom
              by her magic art she changed into a bird<note place="bottom">See below, <hi rend="i"
                  >Mythology of Italy.</hi></note>. Another legend made her the mother of Faunus by
              the god of the sea<note place="bottom">Nonnus, xiii. 328.</note>.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Moly</hi> (<hi rend="i">μῶλν</hi>), is
              said by these late writers to have sprung from the blood of a giant slain by Helios,
              in aid of his daughter in her island. Its name, we are told, comes from the fight (<hi
                rend="i">μῶλος</hi>) ; its flower is white, as the
              warrior was the Sun<note place="bottom">Ptol. Hephæst. iv.</note>.</p>
            <p>In Ææa, the poet says<note place="bottom">Od. xii. 3.</note>, are ‘the house and
              dance-place of Eôs, and the rising of the Sun.’ By this he is usually understood to
              mean that Ææa, in opposition to the country beyond the Ocean, from which his hero had
              just returned, lay within the realms of day<note place="bottom">Sch. <hi rend="i">in
                  loc.</hi> Völcker, Hom. Geog. 131.</note>. This may very possibly be the truth ;
                <pb n="269" xml:id="p269"/>but we cannot help fancying that our poet, in the
              plenitude of his authority, had seized on the Argonautic cycle, and transferred Æætes
              and Ææa to the West, from their proper place in the East<note place="bottom">See
                below, <hi rend="i">Argonautics.</hi></note> ; and he may have retained the
              description of Ææa, which accords perfectly with its eastern position<note
                place="bottom">See above, p. 54.</note>, but which requires a sleight of ingenuity,
              like that just noticed, to make it suit the West.</p>
            <p>On surveying the ‘beautiful wonders’ of the Odyssey, it is impossible not to be
              struck with the resemblance which many of them bear to those of the Thousand and One
              Nights. Odysseus and Circe remind us at once of king Beder and queen Labe ; and the
              Cyclopes and the Læstrygonians will find their parallel in the adventures of Sindbad.
              Are these, it may be asked, mere coincidences, or did the tales of the West find their
              way to the East ? On this question we have offered some remarks elsewhere, to which we
              must refer the curious<note place="bottom">Tales and Popular Fictions,

            <p>Leaving Ææa on their homeward voyage, Odysseus and his companions came first to the
              island of the Sirens. These were two maidens<note place="bottom">Od. xii. 52.
                167.</note> who sat in a mead close to the sea, and with their melodious voices so
              charmed those who were sailing by, that they forgot home and everything relating to
              it, and abode there till their bones lay whitening on the strand. By the directions of
              Circe, Odysseus stopped the ears of his companions with wax, and had himself tied to
              the mast, and thus was the only person who heard the song of the Sirens and
              escaped.</p>
            <p>Hesiod<note place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. iv. 892.</note> described the mead of the
              Sirens as blooming with flowers (<hi rend="i">ἀνθϵμόϵσσα</hi>), and their voice he
                said<note place="bottom">Sch. Od. xii. 169.</note> stilled the winds. Their names
              were said to be Aglaiopheme (<hi rend="i">Clear-voice</hi>) and Thelxiepeia (<hi
                rend="i">Magic-speech</hi>) ; and it was feigned that they threw themselves into the
              sea with vexation at the escape of Odysseus<note place="bottom">Sch. Od. xii.
                39.</note>. But the author of the Orphic Argonautics places them <pb n="270"
                xml:id="p270"/>on a rock near the shore of Ætna, and makes the song of Orpheus end
              their enchantment, and cause them to fling themselves into the sea, where they were

            <p>It was afterwards fabled that they were the daughters of the river-god Acheloös by
              the Muse Terpsichore or Calliope, or by Sterope, daughter of Porthaôn<note

              names are given with much variety. According to some they were called Leucosia, Ligeia
              and Parthenope<note place="bottom"><p>Eudocia, 373. Tzetz. Lyc. 712. The tomb of
                  Parthenope gave name to the city afterwards called Neapolis (Naples). Milton thus

            <p>Contrary to the usual process, the mischievous part of the character of the Sirens
              was in process of time left out, and they were regarded as purely musical beings with
              entrancing voices. Hence Plato in his Republic<note place="bottom">Lib. x. p. 617.
                Comp. Milton, Arcades, 62. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> places one of them on each
              of the eight celestial spheres, where their voices form what is called the music of
              the spheres ; and when (Ol. 94, l.) the Lacedæmonians had laid siege to Athens,
              Dionysos, it is said, appeared in a dream to their general, Lysander, ordering him to
              allow the funeral rites of the new Siren to be <pb n="271" xml:id="p271"/>celebrated,

            <p>Eventually, however, the artists laid hold on the Sirens, and furnished them with the

            <p>The ordinary derivation of the word Siren is from <hi rend="i">σϵίρα, a chain</hi>,

            <p>Having escaped the Sirens, and shunned the Wandering Rocks, which Circe had told him
              lay beyond the mead of these songsters, Odysseus came to the terrific Scylla and
              Charybdis, between which the goddess had informed him his course lay. She said<note
                place="bottom">Od. xii. 73.</note> he would come to two lofty cliffs opposite each
              other, between which he must pass. One of these cliffs towers to such a height that
              its summit is for ever enveloped in clouds, and no man even if he had twenty hands and
              as many feet could ascend it. In the middle of this cliff, she says, is a cave facing
              the west, but so high that a man in a ship passing under it could not shoot up to it
              with a bow. In this den dwells Scylla <hi rend="i">(Bitch)</hi>, whose voice sounds
              like that of a young whelp : she has twelve feet, and six long necks, with a terrific
              head and three rows of close-set teeth on each. Evermore she stretches out these necks
              and catches the porpoises, sea-dogs, and other large animals of the sea which swim by,
              and out of every ship that passes each mouth takes a man.</p>
            <p>The opposite rock, the goddess informs him, is much lower, for a man could shoot over
              it. A wild fig-tree grows on it, stretching its branches down to the water : but
              beneath, <pb n="272" xml:id="p272"/>‘divine Charybdis’ three times each day absorbs
              and regorges the dark water. It is much more dangerous, she adds, to pass Charybdis
              than Scylla.</p>
            <p>As Odysseus sailed by, Scylla took six of his crew ; and when, after he had lost his
              ship and companions, he was carried by wind and wave, as he floated on a part of the
              wreck, between the monsters, the mast by which he supported himself was sucked in by
              Charybdis. He held by the fig-tree till it was thrown out again, and resumed his
              voyage.</p>
            <p>Such is the earliest account we have of these monsters, in which indeed it may be
              doubted if Charybdis is to be regarded as an animate being. The whole fable is
              evidently founded on the wonderful tales of sailors respecting the distant regions of
              the Mediterranean. The ancients, who were so anxious to localise all the wonders of
              Homer, made the straits of Messina the abode of Scylla and Charybdis ; but as there is
              no whirlpool there at all resembling Charybdis, the most that can be said is, that
              that strait may have given occasion to the fable. Homer, however, would seem to place
              the cliffs of Scylla and Charybdis somewhere between the Wandering Rocks and Thrinakia
              (if this last be Sicily) ; for it is after passing those rocks that Odysseus comes to
              the latter island, on which the oxen of the Sun grazed.</p>
            <p>In Homer the mother of Scylla is named Cratæis<note place="bottom">Od. xii.

              the flocks and herds of the Sun-god fed, under the care of his daughters Phaëthusa and
              Lampetia, and to which he would come immediately after escaping Scylla and Charybdis.
              Odysseus was desirous of obeying the injunctions which he had received ; but as it was
              evening when he came to the island, his companions forced him to consent to their
              landing and passing the night there. They promised to depart in the morning, and took
              an oath to abstain from the cattle of the Sun. During the night a violent storm came
              on ; and for an entire month afterwards a strong south-east wind (Euros and Notos)
              blew, which confined them to the island. When their provisions were exhausted, they
              lived on such birds and fish as they could catch. At length, while Odysseus was
              sleeping, Eurylochos prevailed on them to slaughter some of the sacred oxen in
              sacrifice to the gods, and to vow by way of amends a temple to Helios<note

              on the spits. They fed for six days on the sacred cattle ; on the seventh the storm
              fell, and they left the island ; but as soon as they had lost sight of land, a
              terrible west-wind, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and pitch darkness, came on.
              Zeus struck the ship with a thunderbolt : it went to pieces, and all the sacrilegious

            <p>The resemblance between Thrinakia and Trinacria<note place="bottom">Thucydides (vii.
                1.) is we believe the first writer who uses the name Trinacria</note>, a name of
              Sicily, has induced both ancients and moderns to acquiesce in the opinion of the two
              islands being identical. Against this opinion we will observe, that Thrinakia was a
              <hi rend="i">desert isle</hi> (νῆ<hi rend="i">σος ἐρήμηη</hi>)<note
                place="bottom">Od. xii. 351.</note>, that is, an uninhabited isle ; and that during
              the whole month that Odysseus and his men were in it they did not meet with any one,
              and could procure no food but birds and fish ; that it is called the <hi rend="i"
                >excellent isle of the god</hi><note place="bottom">Od. xii. 261.</note>, whose
              peculiar property it therefore must have been ; that according to the analogy of the
              Odyssey it must have been a small island, for such were Ææa, Ogygia, and all that we
              meet ; — not one of which circumstances agrees with Sicily. It seems therefore the
              more probable supposition, that the poet regarded Thrinakia as an islet of about the
              same size as those of Circe and Calypso, belonging to the Sun-god, and tenanted only
              by his flocks and herds, and his two daughters their keepers. He must also have
              conceived it to lie much more to the west than Sicily, for it could not have been more
              than the third day after leaving Ææa that Odysseus arrived at it.</p>

            <p>Odysseus, when his ship had gone to pieces, fastened the mast and keel together, and
              placed himself on them. The wind changing to the south-east (<hi rend="i">νότος</hi>)
              carried him back to Scylla and Charybdis. As he came by the latter, she absorbed the
              mast and keel, but the hero caught hold of the fig-tree, and held by it till they were
              thrown out again. He then floated along for nine days ; and on the tenth reached
                Ogygia<note place="bottom">Properly the ‘Ogygian Isle.’ See Appendix (D).</note>,
              the <pb n="275" xml:id="p275"/>isle of Calypso, by whom he was most kindly received
              and entertained. She detained him there for eight years, designing to make him
              immortal, and to keep him with her for ever : but Hermes arriving with a command from
              Zeus, she was obliged to consent to his departure. She gave the hero tools to build a
              raft or light vessel, supplied him with provisions, and reluctantly took a final leave
              of him.</p>
            <p>Calypso, that is <hi rend="i">The Concealer</hi> (the poet after his usual manner
              giving her a significant name), is called by Homer<note place="bottom">Od. i. 52 ;

                >human-speaking</hi> goddess, and dwelt in solitary state with her attendant
              nymphs ; but her abode was a cavern, while the daughter of Helios possessed a mansion
              of cut stone. Her isle presented such a scene of silvan beauty as charmed even Hermes,
              one of the dwellers of Olympos<note place="bottom">Od. v. 72. <hi rend="i"

            <p>The poet seems to have conceived Ogygia to lie in the northwestern part of the
              West-sea, far remote from all the other isles and coasts ; and he thus brought his
              hero into all parts of that sea, and informed his auditors of all its wonders. A
              south-east wind carried Odysseus thither on his mast in nine days and nights from
              Charybdis. When he left Ogygia, sailing on his raft, as directed by Calypso, with the
              constellation of the Bear on his left, that is in an easterly or southeasterly
              direction, he came on the eighteenth day within sight of Scheria, the country of the
              Phæacians.</p>

            <p>The Phæacians dwelt originally, we are told, in Hypereia, near the Cyclopes<note
                place="bottom">Od. vi. 4.</note> ; but being oppressed by that savage race, they
              migrated to the isle of Scheria. They were led thither by their king Nausithoös, the
              son of Poseidôn by Peribœa the youngest daughter of Eurymedôn king of the Giants<note
                place="bottom">Od. vi. 7 ; vii. 56.</note>. They were, like the Cyclopes and Giants,
              a people akin to the gods<note place="bottom">Od. v. 35. Nitzsch <hi rend="i">in

              solitary wayfarers when they met them<note place="bottom">Od. vii. 204.</note>. They
              had abundance of wealth, and lived in the enjoyment of it undisturbed by the alarms of
              war ; for as they ‘dwelt remote from gain-seeking man’<note place="bottom">Od. vi.
                8.</note>, no enemy ever approached their shores ; and they did not even require to
              make use of bows and quivers<note place="bottom">Od. vi. 270.</note>. Their chief
              employment was navigation : their ships, which went with the velocity of the wing of
              birds or of thought<note place="bottom">Od. vii. 36.</note>, were, like the Argo,
              endued with intelligence : they knew every port, and needed no pilot when impelled by
              the rowers<note place="bottom">Od. viii. 556. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>As Odysseus sailed on his raft from Ogygia, the isle of Scheria appeared to him on
              the eighteenth day ‘like a shield in the dark sea’<note place="bottom">Od. v. 279. <hi
                  rend="i">seq.</hi></note> ; and when the storm by which Poseidôn destroyed his
              raft had subsided, he was carried along, as he swam, by a strong northerly wind for
              two days and nights, and on the third day he got on shore in that island<note
                place="bottom">Od. v. 385. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. The princess Nausicaa,
              when reproving the false alarm of her maids at the sight of him, says<note
                place="bottom">Od. vi. 200.</note>, “Do you think he is an enemy ? There is not a
              living mortal, nor will there be, who will come bearing war to the land of the
              Phæacians ; for they are very dear to the Immortals. We dwell apart in the wavefull
              sea, the last ; nor does any other mortal mingle with us : but this is some
              unfortunate wanderer who has come hither.” In another place, when noticing the
              occasion for scandal which her appearance in company with Odysseus might give, she
              supposes some one to say<note place="bottom">Od. vi. 278.</note>, “Is it some stranger
              who has strayed from his ship that she has taken under her care, since there are no
              people near us ?” All this would seem to indicate some very remote position ; and a
              passage in which Alcinoös says, that the Phæacians had conveyed Rhadamanthys to
                Eubœa<note place="bottom">Od. vii. 321. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Payne Knight
                pronounces the whole passage 311-333 to be spurious, and we think his reasons
                satisfactory. Aristarchus suspected the first six lines.</note> and returned on the
              same day, might lead to the supposition of Scheria being to the west of Ithaca ; for
              the <pb n="277" xml:id="p277"/>abode of Rhadamanthys was the Elysian Plain on the
              shore of Ocean<note place="bottom">Od. iv. 564.</note>. It was on the west side of
              Ithaca, we may observe, that the Phæacians landed Odysseus ; and if we are right in
              placing the Cyclopes on the coast of Libya, Scheria most probably lay in the sea
              somewhere to the north of it. The truth is, the Phæacians and their island are
              altogether as imaginary as any of the isles and tribes which we have already
              noticed, — all as ideal as those visited by Sindbad or Gulliver, — a circumstance
              which in reality gives additional charms to this most delightful poem<note
                place="bottom">This is also the opinion of Nitzsch. <hi rend="i">Erklär. Anmerk. zur
                  Odyssee</hi>, ii. 72-78.</note>.</p>
            <p>The place determined by both ancients and moderns to be Scheria is the island of
                Corcyra<note place="bottom">Thuc. i. 25 ; iii. 70. Apoll. Rh. iv. 982. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq. cum Schol.</hi> Tzetz. Lyc. 818.</note>, the modern Corfu, which lies at a
              very short distance from the coast of Epeiros. It would not perhaps be allowable to
              urge, that the circumstances of the preceding paragraph do not by any means apply to
              Corcyra, for we know not what the Ionian Singer’s idea of it may have been. All we
              will say is, that his language respecting it accords much better with some imaginary
              western isle than with Corcyra ; and that if the Cyclopes were on the coast of Libya,
              Corcyra could not have been Scheria. The firm persuasion of the identity of these two
              islands seems to have been produced by two passages of the poem, the one in which
              Eurymedusa, the attendant of Nausicaa, is said to have been brought from Apeiros,
              which is taken to be Epeiros<note place="bottom">The first syllable of <hi rend="i"
                  >ἄπϵιρος</hi> is short, that of <hi rend="i">ἤπϵιρος</hi> is long. On this however
                  <hi rend="i">we</hi> should lay no stress.</note> ; the other the fictitious

                  >seq.</hi></note>, in which, speaking in an assumed character, he says that
              Odysseus, when shipwrecked after leaving Thrinakia, had reached Scheria, and had gone
              thence to Thesprotia, which was consequently supposed to be near it ; and as Corcyra
              was the principal island in that direction, it was at once inferred to be that of the
              Phæacians. Völcker lays great stress on the circumstance of Penelope seeing nothing
              incongruous in the narrative ; but it surely does not follow that she knew <pb n="278"
                xml:id="p278"/>anything of either Thrinakia or Scheria, and Odysseus may have taken
              the liberty of assigning a false position to this last place. We finally think, that
              if Thesprotia and its oracle at Dodona were so well known to the poet as they seem to
              have been, he never could have described the Phæacians, supposing Corcyra to be their
              island, as dwelling so remote.</p>
            <p>Two islands remain to be considered, in order to finish our view of the isles and

              Ortygia. Eumæos<note place="bottom">Od. xv. 403. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>,
              describing his native isle Syria, says that it lies <hi rend="i">beyond</hi> (<hi

              fruitful, abounding in sheep, in pasturage, in vines, and in corn : it is never
              visited by famine or by any disease ; but when the people grow old, ‘silver-bowed
              Apollo comes with Artemis and kills them with his gentle darts.’ It contained two
              towns ; between the inhabitants of which, who were governed by one king, all things in
              it were divided. The Phœnicians and Taphians visited it for the sake of trade.</p>
            <p>It is almost impossible, we should think, not to recognise in Ortygia and Syria two
              happy isles of the West-sea, apparently sacred to Apollo and Artemis ; and we must
              marvel at those ancients and moderns who place them in the Ægæan, making the one the
              same as Delos<note place="bottom">Apoll. Rh. i. 419. Virg. Æn. iii. 124. 143. 154.
                Servius on ver. 73. Müller (Die Dorier. i. 377.) maintains that the Ortygia of this
                place in the Odyssey is Delos. As this passage does not appear in the English

                5. Müller asserts positively in the Orchomenos (p. 126.) that this is the island
                meant in the Odyssey. Perhaps (see preceding note) he now thinks
              differently.</note>. The Phœnicians, be it observed, who stole away Eumæos, sailed
              with a favourable wind <pb n="279" xml:id="p279"/>homewards during six days : on the
              seventh Eumæos’ nurse died, and wind and water carried them on to Ithaca, where they
              sold him to Laërtes. Their course was therefore evidently from the west or north-west
              toward Sidôn, as Ithaca lay in their way. When however the Greeks settled in Sicily,
              they named the islet before the port of Syracuse Ortygia ; and the tongue of land
              opposite to it was probably pronounced to be Syria.</p>
            <p>The ‘<hi rend="i">turnings of the sun</hi>’ seems merely to denote a westerly
              position, and to be an expression of the same nature with that of the ‘<hi rend="i"
                >risings of the sun</hi>’ being in Ææa. Müller<note place="bottom">Orchom.
                326.</note> sees in it a reference to the sun-dial of Pherecydes of Syros, and
              regards the verse which mentions it as the interpolation of a rhapsodist.</p>
            <p>The narrative of Eumæos may serve to throw some light on the trade of the Phœnicians
              in those early ages. Supposing Syria to have lain to the west of Greece, it follows
              that this people were known to make commercial voyages in that direction ; and we may
              also collect from it that it was chiefly ornamental articles (ἀθύρματα) which they
              offered for sale. The ship whose crew carried off Eumæos continued an entire year at
              Syria, to dispose of her cargo and lay in one in return, — a circumstance which may
              tend to illustrate the three years’ voyages of the fleets of king Solomon<note
                place="bottom">Compare Pliny, xii. 19.</note>. It also appears that the Greeks made
              voyages to both the East and the West ; for the nurse of Eumæos was daughter of Arybas
              a wealthy Sidonian, who had been carried away from her native country by Taphian
              pirates, and sold to the father of Eumæos.</p>
            <p>We have now completed our survey of the magic isles and coasts, the mild and savage
              tribes, the gentle or pernicious goddesses, with which poetic imagination, working
              probably on the ‘shipman’s tale’ of marvellous adventure and frequent peril, had
              filled the little-explored waters of the Mediterranean. While presenting our own
              hypothesis respecting them, <pb n="280" xml:id="p280"/>we wish not to conceal those of
              others, or dogmatically demand assent to what we advance. Our object has been to
              endeavour by these elucidations to enhance the delight which every person of taste
              must feel when perusing one of the most charming monuments of human genius, — the

            <head><hi rend="i">Origin and First State of Man.</hi></head>
            <p rend="noindent">The origin of mankind, like that of the earth their abode, is a
              subject which will be found to have engaged the thoughts of almost every race that
              occupies its surface. The mind feels itself invincibly impelled to this reflection,
              from observing the changes and revolutions which continually take place around it.
              Each revolving year brings to the vegetable world the seasons of decay and of
              reviviscence ; mankind are born, flourish, and die ; a new generation is ever filling
              up the vacancies caused by death ; races migrate ; where population once flourished,
              there is desolation ; where once the wilderness spread, is heard the busy hum of men,
              and commerce and agriculture display their stores. Has it always been so ? is the
              question man naturally asks himself. Has the world ever gone on thus decaying and
              renewing ? — and he carries back his thoughts through ages and generations, till for
              very weariness he is obliged to stop somewhere and suppose a beginning.</p>
            <p>A remnant of original tradition, or the natural operation of the mind itself, has led
              almost all races to conceive the original state of man to have been one of peace and
              happiness. At all periods of his life man looks back to the gay and careless days of
              childhood with pleasure and regret. Then, while his faculties were new and unworn,
              each part of nature was a source of bliss ; then suns shone more brightly, plants
              diffused more <pb n="282" xml:id="p282"/>fragrance, the melody of groves was poured
              forth more rapturously, the day closed in joy, the morning awoke to renewed delight.
              It was easy and it was natural to transfer these ideas to the race of man ; to suppose
              them also to have commenced in blissful infancy, amid the abundant wealth and careless
              ease of nature, and to have progressively passed through different stages,
              deteriorating in each successive stage as unhappily the greater part of mankind do,
              and from the innocence of childhood, advancing to the selfishness and hardened vice of
              mature and declining age. Most mythic systems therefore have their golden age<note

            <head><hi rend="i">Ages of the World</hi>.</head>
            <p>Homer nowhere speaks of cosmogony or of the ages of the world. Hesiod, who is the
              first that treats of them, gives in his didactic poem the following venerable
                mythe<note place="bottom">Works, 108. See above, p. 69.</note>.</p>
            <p>The gods first made the golden race of men, who were in the time when Kronos ruled in
              heaven. They lived like gods, free from toils and care, and death was to them a
              sinking into gentle slumber ; and when earth had covered this race, they became good
              terrestrial dæmons, the guardians of mortal men, to mark their just and unjust deeds.
              They move along the earth shrouded in darkness, and are the bestowers of wealth. Such
              is their regal honour<note place="bottom">See Plato, Laws, iv. p. 713.</note>.</p>
            <p>The gods made a second far inferior race, called the silver race, resembling the
              golden neither in appearance nor in disposition. A hundred years each child spent in
              ignorant simplicity with its mother, and when they attained to youth they lived but a
              short time, for they would not abstain from mutual injury, nor pay the service due to
              the gods. Zeus in indignation put a period to the race.</p>
            <p>Zeus now made a third, the brazen race of men, unlike the silver race. These were
              formed from ash-trees : their delight was in war and deeds of violence. They ate not
              corn, but they had souls of steel, and prodigious strength. Their arms were brass,
              their houses brass, with brass they wrought, ‘for <pb n="283" xml:id="p283"/>black
              iron was not yet.’ At length, slain by each other's hands, they went down to the
              ‘mouldy house of cold Aïdes,’ and left no fame behind them.</p>
            <p>A fourth and better race was next placed on the earth by Zeus, namely the divine race
              of heroes, in former times called Semigods. These also were carried off by war and
              combat. They fought at Thebes, on account of the sheep of Œdipûs, and sailed to Troy
              for ‘well-haired Helena.’ When they died, Zeus removed them to the ends of the earth,
              where they dwell, away from man, in the Islands of the Blest, and live in bliss, earth
              producing for them ‘honey-sweet fruit’ thrice in each revolving year.</p>
            <p>The poet draws a dismal picture of the fifth or iron race of men ; a picture often
              since his time redrawn by moralists and poets in every region of the earth, for this
              is the race who still possess it. This race, says Hesiod, will never cease day or
              night from toil and misery ; the gods will give them grievous cares, yet good will
              still be mixed with the evil. Zeus will destroy this race also, when they become
              ‘hoary-templed.’ Fathers will not be at unity with their children, nor brethren with
              each other ; friends and guests will be discordant, children will not honour their
              aged parents. Club-law will prevail, faith and justice will be in no repute, the
              evil-doer and the violent will be most esteemed, ‘evil-loving Envy’ will accompany
              wretched man. Shame and Aversion (<hi rend="i">Nemesis</hi>) will wrap themselves in
              their ‘white mantles’ and depart to the gods, leaving misery to man ; and there will
              be no defence against evil.</p>
            <p>Aratus<note place="bottom">Phænomena, 100. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> is the next
              in order of time who mentions the ages of the world. He speaks of but three races of
              men, — the golden, the silver, and the brazen. Justice (<hi rend="i">Δίκη</hi>), he
              says, dwelt familiarly among the first, teaching them what was right and good. When
              the silver race succeeded she retired to the mountains, whence she occasionally came
              down in the evening-time, and approaching their abodes upbraided them with their evil
              doings. Unable to endure the third race, who first forged arms and fed on the flesh of
              the labouring ox, she flew <pb n="284" xml:id="p284"/>up to heaven and became the
              constellation of Astræa or the Virgin.</p>
            <p>Ovid<note place="bottom">Met. i. 89. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> makes the races of
              men four in number, — golden, silver, brazen, and iron. The first enjoyed a perpetual
              spring, the earth producing everything spontaneously for them : in the time of the
              second the division of the seasons took place : the third were martial, but not yet
              utterly wicked : the fourth gave way to every species of vice and crime, Astræa left
              the earth, and Zeus destroyed them by a deluge of water.</p>
            <p>In all these accounts it is to be observed that it is <hi rend="i">races</hi> of men,
              not <hi rend="i">ages</hi> of the world, which are spoken of<note place="bottom">So
                also Virgil (Buc. iv. 9. Geor. ii. 537.) and Claudian (Rapt. Pros. ii.
              286.).</note>. Hesiod makes these races separate creations : the two first, he says,
              were made by the gods, the three last by Zeus, who attained the supremacy of heaven in
              the time of the second or silver race. Earth covers each race before its successor is
              made. Aratus expressly says that the golden were the parents of the silver, and these
              of the brazen race of men. Ovid would appear to view the subject in the same
              light.</p>
            <p>To dispel the gloomy prospect presented by the delineation of the vices and miseries
              of man in the last stage of the progression, it was asserted, that as the four
              seasons, commencing with a bright golden spring and ending with a gloomy iron winter,
              form the solar year, which is continually renewed ; so the four ages of the world
              compose a mundane year which will also be renewed, and the iron race be succeeded by a
              new one of gold, when Kronos will once more assume the government, and the former
              innocent and happy state return<note place="bottom">Virg. Buc. iv. 6. Voss. <hi

            <p>A mythologist, of whom even when we dissent from his opinions we must always admire
              the sound learning, ingenious reasoning, and high moral feeling<note place="bottom"
                >Buttmann, Mytholog. ii. 1. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>, gives the following view
              of the mythe of the races of man.</p>
            <p>This mythe is an oriental one, derived from the same source with the narrative in the
              first chapters of Genesis, and introduced into Grecian literature by Hesiod, who may
                <pb n="285" xml:id="p285"/>be regarded as the Plato of his age. It contained
              originally, as it is given by Aratus, but the three first ages. Its object was not to
              give a view of the gradual deterioration of mankind, but to exhibit the relation of
              the deity to the wickedness of the human race, and particularly to impress the belief
              that when evil has attained its <hi rend="i">maximum</hi> the gods will destroy
              mankind. To this intent it was necessary to commence with a state of innocence ; and
              the original framer of the mythe probably made the silver and brazen races, instead of
              successively following that of gold, exist simultaneously after it, — effeminacy and
              violence, the two vices into which virtue is most apt to degenerate, being their
              respective characters, — and feigned that the former was gradually extirpated by the
              latter, which was then destroyed by the gods ; but this was misunderstood by Hesiod.
              The account of the fourth and fifth races was an application of the ancient mythe to
              the actual world, and from a moral it became a continuation of the narrative. As the
              working of iron was regarded as a later invention than that of brass or copper, and as
              it is a harder metal, it was naturally selected to express the last and worst race of
              men ; but as tradition spake distinctly of the Heroic race who fought at Thebes and
              Troy, it was necessary to distinguish it from the iron one : hence the cycle is, as it
              were, repeated ; but the latter one, being founded on reality, consists of only two
              parts. The heroes who correspond to the golden race are like them rewarded after
              death, but in an inferior degree : the iron are menaced with utter destruction like
              the brazen.</p>
            <p>This critic is further of opinion that in the original narrative the three races were
              represented as becoming after death three different classes of spirits, the golden
              celestial, the silver terrestrial, and the brazen infernal ; answering to the good and
              evil angels of the religions of the East ; but that, as the Grecian religion
              acknowledged no evil spirits, the poet found it necessary to cut away this last part
              of the original mythe.</p>
            <p>Völcker<note place="bottom">Myth. der Jap. 250. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> on the
              other hand considers the Heroic race to have been an essential part of the original
              mythe, which he regards chiefly on that account as being a post-Homeric <pb n="286"
                xml:id="p286"/>position, framed with a regard to the Homeric and other contemporary
              poems. He also thinks that the lines in which Hesiod describes the deification of the
              golden race are an interpolation, inserted at the time when the intercourse prevailed
              with Egypt, and Grecian philosophers visited that country. As we do not esteem the
              notion of a community of mythology between Greece and Asia and Egypt in the
              ante-Homeric times to rest on any solid foundation, though we freely acknowledge the
              sublimity of that theory, we feel disposed to acquiesce to a certain extent in this
              last opinion, and to reject the ingenious theory stated above.</p>

            <p>According to the Theogony the Titan Iapetos espoused Clymene<note place="bottom"

              father of four sons, Atlas, Menœtios, Prometheus and Epimetheus. We find Iapetos
              frequently joined with Kronos, apart as it were from the other Titans ; and it is
              worthy of notice, that in the Theogony (where there is more of order and method than
              is usually supposed) the account of Iapetos and his progeny immediately succeeds that
              of Kronos and the gods sprung from him. These circumstances, combined with the plain
              meaning of the names of his children, lead to the conclusion of Iapetos being intended
              to represent the origin of the human race.</p>
            <p>The gods are the offspring of Time, and man, say the sacred Scriptures, is ‘born unto
              misery’. It is not unreasonable therefore to find in the name of their progenitor a

                significatory of man’s <hi rend="i">mortality.</hi> The derivations of Prometheus
                and Epimetheus are obvious.</note>. These we shall now proceed to illustrate.</p>
            <p>Menœtios is called by Hesiod<note place="bottom">Theog. 510. 514.</note> the <hi
                rend="i">insolent</hi> and the <hi rend="i">haughty</hi> ; and Zeus, it is added,
              struck him with his thunder and precipitated him into Erebos on account of his
              ‘insolence and excessive manhood ;’ perhaps intimating that pride and haughtiness and
              extreme reliance on his powers hurry man to death. It is said by later writers that
              for his share in the Titan-war Menœtios was hurled into Tartaros, but this arose from
              the misunderstanding of that mythe<note place="bottom">Apollod. i. 2. 3. The accuracy
                of the Theogony is deserving of notice ; as Menœtios belonged to the human race,
                Erebos and not Tartaros was his proper prison.</note>.</p>
            <p>Atlas (<hi rend="i">The Endurer</hi>) occupies a much larger space in mythology than
              Menœtios. Homer<note place="bottom">Od. i. 52.</note> calls him the <hi rend="i"
                >wise</hi> or <hi rend="i">deepthinking</hi> (<hi rend="i">ὀλoόϕρων</hi>), ‘who
              knows all the depths of the sea, and keeps the long pillars which hold heaven and
              earth asunder.’ In the Theogony<note place="bottom">Theog. 517. <hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi></note> he is said to support the heaven on his head and hands in the
              extreme West, a task assigned him by Zeus, in punishment, the later writers say, for
              his share in the Titan-war<note place="bottom">Hygin. 150.</note>.</p>
            <p>Atlas was the father of the fair nymph Calypso, who so long detained Odysseus in her
              umbrageous isle in the distant West<note place="bottom">Od. i. 51.</note>. Pleione, an

              connexion with the position assigned him by Homer and Hesiod, and the species of
              knowledge ascribed to him, and his being the father of two of the celestial
              constellations, it will be perhaps <pb n="288" xml:id="p288"/>difficult to avoid
              assenting to the opinion of one of our ablest mythologists, that in Atlas we may view
              a personification of “navigation, the conquest of the sea by human skill, trade, and
              mercantile profit<note place="bottom">Völcker, Myth. der Jap. 51., with whose views
                Müller agrees.</note>.”</p>
            <p>It is perhaps hardly necessary now to remind the reader that the Atlas of Homer and
              Hesiod is not the personification of a mountain. In the days however when the true
              sense of the venerable mythes of the old time was lost, Atlas, the keeper of the
              pillars that support the heaven, or the dæmon who discharged that office himself,
              became a mountain of Libya. It is however remarkable that in all the legends of this
              kind it is the god or man Atlas who is turned into or gives name to the mountain. Thus
              according to one<note place="bottom">Ovid, Met. iv. 631. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Serv.
                Æn. iv. 246. Tzetz. Lyc. 879.</note> Atlas was a king of the remote West, rich in
              flocks and herds, and master of the trees which bore the golden apples. An ancient
              prophecy delivered by Themis had announced to him that his precious trees would be
              plundered by a son of Zeus. When therefore Perseus, on his return from slaying the
              Gorgon, arrived in the realms of Atlas, and seeking hospitality announced himself to
              be a son of the king of the gods, the western monarch, calling to mind the prophecy,
              attempted to repel him from his doors. Perseus, inferior in strength, displayed the
              head of Medusa, and the inhospitable prince was turned into the mountain which still
              bears his name.</p>
            <p>Another said that he was a man of Libya devoted to astronomy, and that having
              ascended a lofty mountain to make his observations he fell from it into the sea, and
              both sea and mountain were named from him<note place="bottom">Tzetz. Lyc. 879.</note>.
              His supporting the heaven was usually explained by making him an astronomer and the
              inventor of the sphere<note place="bottom">Diodor. iii. 60 ; iv. 27. Virg. Æn. i. 741.

            <p>In Prometheus and Epimetheus are personified the intellectual vigour and weakness of
              man. In this mythe however there is great confusion, for its original sense seems to
              have been lost very early, and Prometheus to have been viewed as a Titan and the
              creator or instructor of man.</p>

              Prometheus took an ox, and dividing it put the flesh and entrails in the hide, and
              wrapping the bones up in the inside fat, desired Zeus to take which he would. The god,
              though aware of the deceit, selected the bones and fat, and in revenge he withheld
              fire from man ; but Prometheus again deceived him, and stealing the fire in a hollow
                staff<note place="bottom">Ν<hi rend="i">άρθηξ, ferula.</hi></note>, brought it and
              gave it to man. Zeus then sent Pandora on earth to deceive man to his ruin, and he
              bound Prometheus with chains to a pillar, and sent an eagle to prey without ceasing on
              his liver, which grew every night as much as it had lost in the day. After a long
              interval of time, however, he consented to Heracles’ slaying the eagle and freeing the

            <p>In this narrative there is a combination of a local mythe of Sicyôn (anciently called
              Mecone), with a doctrine of a much higher nature. The former legend was manifestly
              devised to account for the custom at Sicyôn, as at Sparta, of offering to the gods in
              sacrifice the bones of the victim wrapt in the caul, instead of some of the choicest

              explained the mythe after their own fashion. Prometheus was, they say, a king of the

              within the earth, and then committed to Prometheus and his brother the task of
              distributing powers and qualities to them. Epimetheus prayed to be allowed to make the
              distribution. Prometheus assented ; but when he came to survey the work, he found that
              the silly Epimetheus had abundantly furnished the inferior animals, while man was left
              naked and helpless. As the day for their emerging from the earth was at hand,
              Prometheus was at a loss what to do ; at length as the only remedy he stole fire, and
              with it the artist-skill of Athena and Hephæstos, and gave it to man. He was also
              regarded as the creator of the human race. Another <pb n="291" xml:id="p291"/>legend
              said that all mankind having perished in Deucaliôn’s flood, Zeus directed Prometheus
              and Athena to make images of clay, on which he caused the winds to blow, and thus gave
              them life<note place="bottom">Etym. Mag. and Steph. Byz. <hi rend="i">v</hi>.

              beholding it offered him her aid in procuring anything in heaven that might contribute
              to its perfection. Prometheus said that he could not tell what there might be in
              heaven to his purpose, unless he could go thither and judge for himself. The goddess
              then bore him to heaven in her sevenfold shield, and there seeing everything animated
              by the celestial heat, he secretly applied his <hi rend="i">ferula</hi> to the wheel
              of the Sun’s chariot and thus stole some of the fire, which he then applied to the
              breast of his man and thus animated him. Zeus, to punish Prometheus, bound him and
              appointed a vulture to prey on his liver, and the incensed gods sent fevers and other

              from himself. While they were disputing, Earth arose and asserted her right to it, as
              she had furnished the body. They took Saturn for arbitrator, and he decided that, as
              Jupiter had given it life, he should have the body, but that as Care had formed it she
              should possess it while it lived, and that it should be called Man (<hi rend="i"

              of mankind, they were so ungrateful as to betray him to Zeus. For their treachery they
              got in reward a remedy against the evils of old-age ; but not duly considering the
              value of the gift, instead of carrying it themselves, they put it on the back of an
              ass, and let him trot on before them. It was summer time, and the ass quite overcome
              by thirst went up to a fountain to drink ; but a snake forbade all approach. The ass,
              ready to faint, most earnestly implored relief : the cunning snake, who knew the value
              of the burden which the ass bore, demanded it as the price of access to the fount. The
              ass was forced to comply, and the snake obtained possession of the gift of Zeus, but
              with it as a punishment for his art he got the thirst of the ass. Hence it is that the
              snake by casting his skin annually renews his youth, while man is borne down by the
              weight of the evils of old-age. The malignant snakes moreover, when they have an

                “Pandora.”</note>.</p>
            <p>According to some very ancient mythe the first of mankind were two brothers,
              Prometheus and Epimetheus, that is, Forethought and After-thought. These first men
              lived in intimate relation with the gods, who, as we may have already seen, were by no
              means beings of pure benevolence ; on the contrary, they and mankind were to one
              another somewhat like patrons and <pb n="293" xml:id="p293"/>clients, lords and
              vassals. The latter recognised the power of the former, who on their part could not
              well dispense with the gifts and respect of men ; and men, like the tenants of griping
              landlords, were obliged to be very circumspect, that is, to use a good deal of <hi
                rend="i">forethought</hi> in their actions, to get every advantage they could in
              their dealings with the gods. This is intimated in the transaction respecting the fire
              of which Zeus is said to have deprived men, and which Prometheus stole and brought
              back to earth.</p>
            <p>Zeus then, the mythe goes on to relate, was incensed at this daring deed, and
              resolved to punish the men for it. He therefore directed Hephæstos to knead earth and
              water, to give it human voice and strength, and to make the fair form of a virgin like
              the immortal goddesses : he desired Athena to endow her with artist-knowledge,
              Aphrodite to give her beauty and desire, and Hermes to inspire her with an impudent
              and artful disposition. When formed she was attired by the Seasons and Graces ; each
              of the deities gave the commanded gifts, and she was named Pandora (<hi rend="i"
                >All-gifted</hi>). Thus furnished she was brought by Hermes to the dwelling of
              Epime-theus ; who, though his brother had warned him to be upon his guard and to
              receive no gifts from Zeus, dazzled with her charms took her to his house and made her
              his wife. The evil effects of this imprudent act were speedily felt. In the house of
              these first men stood a closed jar, which they had been forbidden to open.
              Forethought, as may be supposed, had rigidly obeyed this direction, and had hitherto
              kept his brother also from transgressing it. But the case was now altered : a woman,
              whose chief attribute is <hi rend="i">curiosity</hi>, was come into the house : dying
              to know what the jar contained she raised the lid, and all the evils hitherto unknown
              to man poured out and spread over the earth. In terror at the sight of these monsters,
              she clapped down the lid just in time to prevent the escape of Hope, who thus remained
              with man, his chief support and comfort.</p>
            <p>This fable of Pandora is certainly not capable of being reconciled with other
              Hellenic mythes of the origin of mankind, such as the one which we have given above ;
              but incongruities little discomposed those ancient bards, and if a mythe contained a
              moral that pleased them, they were indifferent <pb n="294" xml:id="p294"/>about its
              harmonising with others. Contradictions however becoming apparent, Prometheus and his
              brother ceased to be looked on as the first men, but Pandora still kept her place as
              the first woman. Prometheus and Epimetheus were soon regarded as the symbols of
              Prudence and Folly, and were held to be gods. From the remote period in which the
              legends placed them they could only be regarded as Titans, and accordingly by Hesiod
              and Æschylus they are placed among that ante-Kronid race. Prometheus was also speedily
              raised to the rank of creator of mankind, to whom he gave the fire which he had stolen
              from heaven. Yet even so late as the times of Augustus some vestige of the old sense
              of the mythe seems to have remained ; for Horace classes Prometheus with Dædalos and
              Heracles, and speaks of him as a man<note place="bottom"><quote><l> Audax omnia

              benefactor and instructor of mankind.</p>
            <p>The next step in the corruption of the mythe, says the critic, was to change the jar
                (<hi rend="i">πίθoς</hi>)<note place="bottom">Π<hi rend="i">ίθos</hi>, akin to the
                Latin <hi rend="i">vas</hi>, the German <hi rend="i">fass</hi>, and our words <hi
                  rend="i">butt</hi> and <hi rend="i">pot</hi>, was a kind of large pitcher or jar
                with a wide mouth and a close-fitting lid. It was usually earthen, and was mostly
                employed for holding wine.</note> in which the evils were inclosed, and which lay in
              the house of the men, into a <hi rend="i">box</hi> brought with her from heaven by
              Pandora. It is rather strange how this notion could have prevailed, when the species
              of vessel was so expressly stated by Hesiod, who also mentions its <hi rend="i">great

              an unprejudiced reader will rather conceive the passage to denote that a house was the
              scene of the event, and that Hope alone stayed in the dwelling of man.</p>
            <p>When higher notions of the Deity prevailed, this mythe underwent a further change,
              and it was fabled that Zeus had inclosed all blessings in a jar, which he set in the
              abode of man. But, tormented with curiosity, man raised the lid, and all the blessings
              flew away to heaven, where they abide shunning the earth. Hope alone remained, as he
              let down the lid before she had escaped<note place="bottom">Babrius. See Tyrwhitt,

            <p>Such is what may be regarded as the best explanation that has been given of this
              ancient mythe. We will now make a few observations on the subject.</p>
            <p>In the first place, as Buttmann and many others have observed, the resemblance
              between this mythe and the Scripture narrative of Eve and the forbidden fruit is so
              very striking, that one might be induced to regard it as a rivulet derived from the
              original fount of tradition. It is however more probably an ebullition of that spleen
              against the female sex occasionally exhibited by the old Grecian bards, and of which
              Simonides has left a notable instance<note place="bottom">Frag. 2. Gaisford, Poetæ

              and the jar of evils ; and the introduction of evil into the world by the first woman.
              But Eve was tempted, Pandora was not ; the former was actuated by a noble instinct,
                <pb n="296" xml:id="p296"/>the love of knowledge ; the latter merely by vulgar
              female curiosity.</p>
            <p>It seems very strange that the ancients should have taken so little notice of this
              mythe. There is no allusion to it in Pindar or the tragedians, excepting Sophocles,
              one of whose lost satyric dramas was named Pandora or the Hammerers. It was equally
              neglected by the Alexandrians ; Apollodorus merely calls Pandora the first woman. In
              fact, with the exception of a dubious passage in Theognis<note place="bottom"
                >Parænesis, 1135. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Compare Ovid, Ex Pont. i. 6. 29.</note>,
              where Hope is said to be the only good deity that remained among men, — Temperance,
              Faith, and the others having left the earth and gone to Olympos, — which may be
              founded on this mythe, we find no allusion to it in Grecian literature, except in the
              fable of Babrius, who is said to have been anterior to Phædrus, in Nonnus<note
                place="bottom">Dionys. vii. 56. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>, who left nothing
              untouched, and in the epigrammatist Macedonius<note place="bottom">Anthologia
                (Palat.), x. 71.</note>. It seems to have had as little charms for the Latin poets ;
              even Ovid (strange as it may appear) passing it over in perfect silence. Hyginus<note
                place="bottom">Fab. 142.</note> merely says that, when Prometheus formed men of
              clay, Zeus directed Hephæstos to make a woman of clay also, whom Athena animated and
              the other gods adorned with gifts ; and that she was given in marriage to Epimetheus,
              and became the mother of Pyrrha, the first mortal woman.</p>
            <p>It is also deserving of notice, that Hesiod and all the others agree in naming the
              vessel which Pandora opened a <hi rend="i">jar</hi> (<hi rend="i">πίθος</hi>), and
              never hint at her having brought it with her to the house of Epimetheus. Yet the idea
              has been universal among the moderns that she brought all the evils with her from
              heaven shut up in a <hi rend="i">box</hi> (<hi rend="i">πυξίς</hi>). We can only
              account for this by supposing that at the restoration of learning the narrative in
              Hesiod was misunderstood ; and of this we have a convincing proof in Natalis Comes,
              one of the earliest of the modern mythologists. He says that Zeus sent Pandora to
              Prometheus with all the evils inclosed in a vessel (<hi rend="i">vasculo</hi>), and
              that when Prometheus refused to receive her she went to Epimetheus, who took the lid
              off the vessel and let out all the evils, but <pb n="297" xml:id="p297"/>that he shut
              up Hope, and kept the vessel with her in it<note place="bottom">Mythol. lib. iv. chap.

              even so eminent a scholar as Buttmann was deceived by it, and led to suppose such to

            <p>We have seen that the ancient mythology of Greece contained accounts of the two great
              events of the Creation and Fall of man. In like manner the important event of the
              Deluge has a place among the ancient Hellenic mythes ; but unfortunately it has come
              down to us only in a late form, and apparently mixed up with circumstances borrowed
              from the narrative in the Mosaic history. It is to the following effect.</p>
            <p>Deucaliôn, the son of Prometheus, was married to Pyrrha the daughter of Epimetheus
              and Pandora, and he reigned over the country about Phthia. When Zeus designed to
              destroy the brazen race of men, Deucaliôn by the advice of his father made himself an
              ark (<hi rend="i">λὰ</hi>ρνακα), and putting provisions into it entered it with his
              wife Pyrrha. Zeus then poured rain from heaven and inundated the greater part of
              Greece, so that all the people, except a few who escaped to the neighbouring lofty
              mountains, perished in the waves. At that time the mountains of Thessaly were burst,
              and all Greece without the Isthmus and the Peloponnese was overflowed. Deucaliôn was
              carried along this sea in his ark for nine days and nights until he reached Mount
              Parnassos. By this time the rain had ceased, and he got out and sacrificed to Zeus <hi
                rend="i">Flight-giving</hi> (Φ<hi rend="i">ύξιoς</hi>), who sent Hermes desiring him
              to ask what he would. His request was to have the earth replenished with men. By the
              direction of Zeus he and his wife flung stones behind them ; and those which Deucaliôn
              cast became men, those thrown by Pyrrha women ; and from this circumstance came the
              Greek name for <hi rend="i">people</hi><note place="bottom">Apollod. i. 7, 2. The
                escape to Parnassos, and the origin of men from stones, are noticed by Pindar, Ol.

            <p>This narrative, it may easily be seen, is of a very narrow <pb n="298" xml:id="p298"
              />and even unpoetic character ; it restricts the general deluge to Greece Proper,
              indeed perhaps originally to Thessaly<note place="bottom">See Aristot. Meteor. i.
                14.</note> ; and it most incongruously represents others having escaped as well as
              Deucaliôn, yet at the same time intimates that he and his wife alone had been
              preserved in the catastrophe. What is said of the Brazen Age is quite at variance with
              the narrative in Hesiod, and is a very clumsy attempt at connecting two perfectly
              independent and irreconcilable mythes. The circumstance of the <hi rend="i">ark</hi>
              would seem to have been learned at Alexandria<note place="bottom">It may however have

              sacrifice and the appearance of Hermes also strongly remind us of Noah.</p>

              small boat to the summit of Parnassos ; while others make Ætna<note place="bottom"

              to this poet, they consulted the ancient oracle of Themis respecting the restoration
              of mankind, and received the following response :</p>

              carries off the waters that run into the vale of Thessaly, which is on all sides shut
              in by lofty mountains, had been closed by some accident, they overflowed the whole of
              its surface, till the action of subterranean fire opened a way for them. We are not by
              any means to assert that this inundation was a real event, of which the memory had
              been retained by tradition from times long anterior to Homer and Hesiod, who make no
              mention of it ; neither should we perhaps be too forward to maintain that a tradition
              of the great deluge was preserved by the early inhabitants of Greece. Where there are
              not letters to fix it, tradition is, as abundant instances prove, remarkably fleeting
              and unstable ; and we should perhaps come nearest to the truth if we were to say, that
              those tribes who appear to have retained a recollection of that great event, have
              inferred it from the evident tokens of inundation which are to be seen on various
              parts of the earth's surface ; a circumstance which, so far from invalidating, tends
              rather to confirm the truth of the Mosaic account of the Deluge.</p>

              overflowed Greece, but the accounts remaining of him are very scanty. The historians
              made him a king of Attica or Bœotia.</p>
            <p>Deucaliôn was regarded as the great patriarch of Greece, or the progenitor of those
              races which derived their origin from Thessaly, and were believed to have advanced
              southwards, conquering and displacing the tribes which previously occupied the more
              southern parts. This flood, we may observe, did not extend to the Peloponnese, and the

            <head>Early Inhabitants of Greece.</head>
            <p>The Homeric poems exhibit to us the people of Greece at the time of the Trojan war as
              a race very far removed from the savage state, as being well acquainted with
              agriculture, commerce and navigation, though probably ignorant of money and letters,
              and exhibiting in all their institutions a considerable degree of civilisation. They
              had not yet any common name, and seem to have had but little previous intercourse with
              foreign nations. Nothing can be collected from these poems respecting the origin of
              the people.</p>
            <p>As some nations of Asia were under the system of castes and the direction of the
              sacerdotal caste, and as some of the early tribes of Europe seem to have been
              similarly situated, some modern writers assume such to have been the early state of
              Greece, and even fancy that they discern in certain places of the Ilias (such for
              example as the quarrel between Agamemnôn and Calchas,) traces of the conflict between
              the temporal and the sacerdotal power<note place="bottom">See Schlegel’s well-known
                review of Niebuhr's History of Rome.</note>. The gigantic buildings which still
              exist in the Peloponnese and elsewhere, and which are alluded to in the Homeric poems,
              also seem to them to indicate a state of society resembling that of Egypt or India,
              where huge pyramids and temples were raised by serfs, beneath the direction of a caste
              of priests, whom they were bound to obey. But unfortunately for this hypothesis, the
              various huge monuments of this kind which Egypt, India, and ‘the Celtic’ present, are
              works of show rather than of real utility, being almost all altars, temples, tombs, or
              obelisks ; while those of Greece are massive walls and strong treasuries, manifestly
              designed to preserve the wealth of an industrious and civilised people from the
              rapacity of invaders by sea or by land. The <pb n="301" xml:id="p301"/>evidence in
              effect of sacerdotal dominion having ever prevailed in Greece is so slight that it
              hardly needs an examination<note place="bottom">See Nitzsch on Od. iii.

            <p>Language, manners, religion, and monuments indicate that Greece and Italy, and a part
              of Lesser Asia were at an early period the abode of one race of men, who were devoted
              to the arts of peace and eminently skilled in agriculture. This people are generally
              called the Pelasgians or Pelargians, a name which was probably given to a portion of
              them by more warlike tribes, from their favourite occupation of cultivating the land,
              but which we have no reason to suppose was ever common to the whole race<note

              determining. The poems give not a hint on the subject, and conjecture will yield but
              little that is satisfactory. No traces occur in them of previous invasions and
              conquests, and it is not at all improbable that the martial character of the race who
              fought at Thebes and Troy may have been developed by peculiar circumstances from the
              peaceful one which is usually supposed to have distinguished the Pelasgians<note

                place="bottom">Herod. vii. 176. Müller, Orchom. 377.</note>, which caused a portion
              of the former inhabitants to emigrate into Bœotia and expel some of those whom they
              found there<note place="bottom">These are said to have been the Bœotians, who
                conquered and expelled the Cadmeians from Thebes. This event is a mere conjecture,
                and it would rather seem to have been the Epigoni who destroyed the Cadmeian power.
                The word Bœotian occurs in Homer in the Catalogue, and in Il. v. 710 ; xiii. 687 ;
                which last however is considered spurious. See also Il. xiv. 476 ; xvii.
              597.</note>. But it was the Dorian migration which produced the greatest changes in
              Greece, and sent so many colonies to the East and the West. It was probably at this
              time that the word Hellenes came into use ; for the Greeks, finding themselves to
              differ in language and manners from the tribes with which they now came in contact,
              adopted a common name by which to distinguish themselves<note place="bottom">Hesiod
                (Works, 528. 653.) first employed the term Hellenes to designate the whole people.
                See Müller, Æginet. 19. 155. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Welcker, Kret. Kol. 49. Niebuhr,
                  <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>It would therefore seem to be the most probable hypothesis on this subject, to
              suppose the Greeks to have been always one people, under different denominations, with
              that diversity of character and manners among the various portions of them which will
              be produced by local situation and other accidental circumstances<note place="bottom"
                >Müller, Proleg. 336.</note>, and which should cause no greater surprise than the
              diversity of dialects of the one language which prevailed in ancient Greece as in
              modern Italy.</p>
            <p>Religion will always vary with modes of life, and there is therefore no improbability
              in the supposition of that of the Pelasgians, that is of the people of Greece before
              the Achæan period, having been chiefly of a rural character<note place="bottom"
                >Völcker, Myth. der Jap. 369. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>, such as it continued to
              be in Arcadia to a late period ; and that, as we have seen in the case of Hermes, when
              the Achæan and Hellenic characters prevailed, the deities like the people put off the
              rustic character, their attributes changed, and offices dissimilar to their original
              ones were assigned them. The original meaning also of many mythes may have gone out of
              use ; what had been symbolical and allegorical may have been understood literally and
              regarded as a real event ; purely imaginary beings have been esteemed actual
              personages, and the <pb n="303" xml:id="p303"/>legends relating to them have been
              treated as genuine history ; and hence have arisen many of the mythic persons, whose
              names indicate them to have been personifications of natural objects, or epithets of
              the divinity in whose mythology they became actors. There is, further, much
              probability in the hypothesis that what afterwards became mysteries were ancient
              Pelasgian forms of worship, preserved in particular places, and jealously confined to
              a particular people, but which were gradually communicated to others<note
                place="bottom">See above, p. 181. Also Müller, Orchom. 453. Æginet. 172.
                Proleg. 250.</note>. In short, it would appear, that the religion, manners, genius,
              and national character of the Greeks of the historie times had their roots in those of
              the ante-historic and even ante-mythic inhabitants of the country, whom we denominate
              Pelasgians. We have already pointed out the incredibility of the hypothesis of the
              coming of foreign colonists to Greece. The various supposed instances will be examined
              as they occur.</p>
            <p>In Grecian history we are to distinguish three periods, the Pelasgian, the Achæan,
              and the Hellenic. The first is ante-historic and even ante-mythic, and its existence
              is only to be inferred from a few feeble traces : the second is the mythic, which is
              rich in events, though the far greater part, if not the entire, are but the creations
              of fancy : the third, commencing with the Dorian migration, and being for some space
              of time mytho-historic or history mingled with fable<note place="bottom">Buttmann,
                Mythol. ii. 210. 217. 226. Müller, Proleg. 165.</note>, assumes toward the time of
              Solôn the lineaments of truth, and becomes real history. It is this last period alone
              which presents materials for the historian.</p>
            <p>The mythic history of Greece, to which the present portion of our work is devoted,
              will present numerous instances of the practice of embodying tribes, institutions,
              religious ceremonies, etc. in the person of some fabled individual, — the
              personification of their name ; a practice by no means confined to Grecian mythology,
              as it will be found to pervade that of almost every other people. The names of rivers,
              mountains, and other natural objects, made persons, also largely contribute to swell
              the amount of our mythic array ; <pb n="304" xml:id="p304"/>to these when we add those
              noticed in a preceding paragraph, but few will remain to which we can venture to
              assign an actual and real existence<note place="bottom">Müller, <hi rend="i">ut

            <p>These mythic personages are usually denominated Heroes (<hi rend="i">ἥρωϵς</hi>), — a
              word in Homer only indicative of civil rank and preeminence<note place="bottom">The

                saine.</note>. It afterwards became significative of beings of a class superior to
              common men<note place="bottom">Pind. Ol. ii. 2, 3. Herodotus (iii. 122.) thus
                distinguishes between Minôs and Polycrates.</note> ; and many of those to whom Homer
              and Hesiod apply the term <hi rend="i">hero</hi>, in its primary sense, were in
              after-times honoured as deities, with temples, sacrifices, and prayers, — becoming in
              fact the <hi rend="i">Saints</hi> of heathen Greece<note place="bottom">Lobeck,
                1233.</note>. In general, however, they only resumed their pristine rank ; for the
              hero of one period was not unfrequently the god of a preceding one, and he thus became
              a god once more in the eyes of posterity.</p>
            <p>The whole mythic history of Greece is genealogical ; all the personifications which
              we have just noticed are woven through one another in a most marvellous manner, and
              the gods also bear a conspicuous part in the history as progenitors of various Heroic
              families. Any attempt therefore at introducing the accuracy of chronology into such a
              chaos is absurd in the extreme<note place="bottom">Buttmann, Mythol. ii. 226. Müller,
                Orchom. 136. Compare Proleg. 330.</note> ; and it is only with the glimmer of the
              dawn of real Grecian history, — of which the first or mytho-historic portion commences
              with the Dorian migration, — that the regular succession of events can be traced with
              any appearance of probability. The mythic portion of a nation’s annals must be always
              regarded as a world in itself<note place="bottom">Müller, Proleg. 103.</note>, the
              creation of fancy, where the real assumes the garb of the imaginary, and becomes
              indistinguishable from it ; where no event can be pronounced absolutely true ; where
              fancy and ingenuity are ever at liberty to sport and lead the inquirer an eager and a
                <pb n="305" xml:id="p305"/>delightful chase after the forms which float before him
              in the distance, but fade into mist when he attempts to grasp them. It is a region of
              sunshine and fragrance, in which the song of the bard evermore resounds, pleasant to
              view and curious to explore ; where the search after truth is rewarded by insight into
              the powers and operations of the human mind, and the fancy is continually nourished
              and inspired by gay and magnificent imagery.</p>
            <p>Though chronology, properly so called, cannot be introduced into mythic history, it
              has however a chronology of its own, and may be divided into distinct periods. In the
              mythic history of Greece, for instance, we find an indefinite period, in which are to
              be placed Cadmos, Cecrops, Perseus, and other heroes ; then follow the times of
              Heracles and Theseus and the Argonautic Expedition ; this period is succeeded by that
              of the Theban Wars, after which come the War of Troy and the Returns of the Heroes,
              with which the mythic portion of Grecian history terminates.</p>
            <p>Two courses present themselves to the narrator of this mythic history. He may either
              take the genealogical one, and relate the history of each mythic family
              consecutively ; or he may pursue the subject geographically, and distribute the mythes
              according to the regions which are assigned as the scenes of them. Without venturing
              to assert that it is the best, we have given the preference to the latter mode, and
              shall commence at Thessaly, the most northerly portion of Greece.</p>
            <p>It must be previously stated, that the genealogists make Deucaliôn the father of
              Hellên, who was the father of Doros, Æolos, and Xuthos, which last had two sons,
              Achæos and Iôn. Of these personified races Æolos alone occupies any space in
              mythology. His sons were Cretheus, Athamas, Sisyphos, Salmoneus and Perieres<note
                place="bottom">Iles. Fr. 23. Eurip. Fr. Æolos, 23. Apollod. i. 7, 3. This last
                writer names several other children of Æolos.</note> ; some of whom belong to the
              mythology of Thessaly, others to that of the Peloponnese, and thus seem to indicate a
              close connexion in the mythic period between these extremes of Hellas.</p>

            <p>Cretheus the son of Æolos married Tyro the daughter of his brother Salmoneus. By her

                257.</note>. This last built the city of Pheræ, which was named from him : his son

            <p>When Apollo was banished from Olympos, the legend says he became the servant of
                Admetos<note place="bottom">Above, p. 121.</note>, and it was during the period of
              his service that Admetos souo his chariot, and this Admetos effected by the aid of his
              divine herdsman. Apollo also obtained from the Fates that, when the day appointed for
              the life of Admetos to terminate should come, he might defer it if any one would die
              in his place. When the fatal day arrived Admetos implored his aged father and mother
              to lay down their small remnant of life for his sake, but they were deaf to his
              prayers. With a generous self-devotion Alcestis then proffered herself as the
              substitute. She therefore died, and was laid in the tomb ; but Heracles happening to
              come just at this time to the house of Admetos, and hearing what had occurred, went
              and sat at the tomb, and when Death (or according to others Hades himself) came, he
              seized him, and forced him to resign his victim, whom he then restored to her <pb

              13.</note>.</p>
            <p>An oracle had told Pelias to beware of the ‘<hi rend="i">one-sandaled</hi> man,’ but
              during many years none such appeared to disturb his repose. At length, when Iasôn had
              attained the age of twenty, he proceeded unknown to Cheirôn to Iolcos, to claim the
              rights of his family. He bore, says the Theban poet, two spears ; he wore the
              close-fitting Magnesian dress, and a pard-skin to throw off the rain, and his long
              unshorn locks waved on his back. He entered the market-place, and the people, who knew
              him not, marvelled if he were Apollo or the ‘brazen-carred spouse of Aphrodite’
              (Ares). Just then Pelias came by in his mule-car ; and the moment he looked on him,
              and perceived that he had but one sandal, he shuddered. He asked him who he was, and
              Iasôn mildly answered his question, telling him that he was come to demand the kingdom
              of his fathers which Zeus had given to Æolos. He then went into the house of his
              father, by whom he was joyfully <pb n="308" xml:id="p308"/>recognised. On the
              intelligence of the arrival of Iasôn, his uncles Pheres and Amythaôn, with their sons
              Admetos and Melampûs, hastened to Iolcos. Five days they feasted and enjoyed
              themselves : on the sixth Iasôn disclosed to them his wishes, and went accompanied by
              them to the dwelling of Pelias, who at once proposed to resign the kingdom, retaining
              the herds and pastures, at the same time stimulating Iasôn to the expedition of the
              Golden Fleece<note place="bottom">Pind. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Another account is that Pelias, being about to offer a sacrifice on the shore of the
              sea to his sire Poseidôn, invited all his subjects. Iasôn, who was ploughing on the
              other side of the Anauros, crossed that stream to come to it, and in so doing lost one
              of his sandals. It is said that Hera, out of enmity to Pelias, who had neglected to
              sacrifice to her, took the form of an old woman, and asked Iasôn to carry her over,
              which caused him to leave one of his sandals in the mud ; her object was to give
              occasion for Medeia's coming to Iolcos and destroying Pelias<note place="bottom"
                >Apollonius (iii. 67. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>) says that Hera did this to make trial
                of the humanity of men.</note>. When Pelias perceived Iasôn with but one sandal, he
              saw the accomplishment of the oracle, and sending for him next day, asked him what <hi
                rend="i">he</hi> would do, if he had the power, had it been predicted to him that he
              should be slain by one of his citizens. Iasôn replied, that he would order him to go
              and fetch the Golden Fleece. Pelias took him at his word, and imposed this task on
                himself<note place="bottom">Pherecydes <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch. Pind. Pyth. iv.
                133.</note>.</p>
            <p>Iasôn proclaimed his enterprise throughout Greece, and the bravest heroes hastened to
              share in the glory. The fleece was gained by the aid of Medeia the daughter of the
              king of Colchis, and the Argo, as the vessel in which they sailed was named, returned
              to Iolcos in safety<note place="bottom">The particulars of this voyage will be related
                below.</note>. But during the absence of Iasôn, Pelias had driven his father and
              mother to self-destruction, and put to death their remaining child. Desirous of
              revenge, Iasôn, after he had delivered the fleece to Pelias, entreated Medeia to
              exercise her art in his behalf. He sailed with his companions to the Isthmos, and
              there <pb n="309" xml:id="p309"/>dedicated the Argo to Poseidôn ; and Medeia shortly
              afterwards ingratiated herself with the daughters of Pelias, and by vaunting her art
              of restoring youth, and proving it by cutting up an old ram, and putting him into a
              pot whence issued a bleating lamb, she persuaded them to treat their father in the
              same manner<note place="bottom">Apollod. i. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>Pelias was buried with great splendour by his son Acastos, and the most renowned
              heroes of the time in Greece contended at the games celebrated on the occasion.
              Acastos drove Iasôn and Medeia from Iolcos, and they retired to Corinth, where they
              lived happily for ten years ; till Iasôn, wishing to marry Glauce or Creusa, the
              daughter of Creôn king of that place, put away Medeia. The Colchian princess, enraged
              at the ingratitude of her husband, called on the gods for vengeance, sent a poisoned
              robe as a gift to the bride, and then killing her own children mounted a chariot drawn
              by winged serpents, and fled to Athens, where she married king Ægeus, by whom she had
              a son named Medos ; but being detected in an attempt to destroy Theseus, she fled with
              her son. Medos conquered several barbarous tribes, and the country which he named
              after himself, and finally fell in battle against the Indians. Medeia returning

            <p>In narrating the adventures of Iasôn and Medeia we have followed Apollodorus, who
              seems to have adhered closely to the versions of the legend given by the Attic
              tragedians, in whose hands the hero and heroine have undergone the same fate with
              those of other places whose people were politically opposed to the sovereign democracy
              of Athens. We will now give the more trustworthy accounts of others.</p>
            <p>In the Theogony Medeia is classed with the goddesses<note place="bottom">Medeia is
                said to be <hi rend="i">immortal</hi> by Pindar (Pyth. iv. 18.) and Musæus (<hi

              love. Iasôn brought her from the realm of her father Æetes, where he had achieved the
              many grievous tasks which the haughty insolent king <pb n="310" xml:id="p310"/>Pelias
              had imposed on him. He made her his spouse, and she bore to the ‘shepherd of the
              people’ a son named Medeios, whom Cheirôn reared in the mountains, and ‘the will of
              great Zeus was accomplished<note place="bottom">Theog. 992. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>
                Pelias is here to Iasôn what Eurystheus is to Heracles.</note>.’ It is evident
              therefore that this poet supposed Iasôn to have reigned at Iolcos after his return
              from his great adventure.</p>
            <p>According to the poem of the Nostoi, Medeia restored Æsôn to youth<note

              in Iasôn himself<note place="bottom">Arg. Eur. Med.</note>, and Æschylus that she thus

                >Arg. Eur. Med. Ovid, <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> ver. 294.</note>. There is also a
              difference in the accounts of the manner in which she contrived to destroy Pelias ;
              for it is said that before the Argo came to Iolcos Medeia landed secretly on the
              coast, and assuming the form of an ancient priestess of Artemis, went to the house of
              Pelias, and deceived his daughters as above related<note place="bottom">Hygin. 24.

                (Orchom. 268.) thinks this was a mere fiction of the tragedians.</note>. She then
              made the appointed signal to Iasôn, who landed and took possession of the kingdom,
              which however he shortly after gave up to Acastos the son of Pelias, who had
              accompanied him on his voyage, and retired with Medeia to Corinth<note place="bottom"
                >Hygin. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> Diodor. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Iasôn is said to have put an end to his life after the tragic fate of his children ;
              or, as another account has it, when the Argo was falling to pieces with time Medeia
              persuaded him to sleep under the prow, and it fell on him and killed him<note
                place="bottom">Arg. Eurip. Medeia.</note>. Medeia herself, we are told, became the
              bride of Achilleus on the Elysian Plain<note place="bottom">Ibycus and Simonides, <hi
                  rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch. Apoll. Rh. iv. 815.</note>.</p>
            <p>Neither Iasôn nor Medeia can well be regarded as a real historical personage. Whether
              the former, whose name is nearly identical with Iasiôn, Iasios, Iasos, is merely a
              personification of the Ionian race (Ἰάονϵς), or, in reference to a mythe to be noticed
              in the sequel, signifies the <hi rend="i">healing, atoning</hi> god or hero, may be
              doubted. Medeia seems plainly to <pb n="311" xml:id="p311"/>be only another form of
              Hera, and to have been separated from her in the manner of which we have already given
              instances. She is the <hi rend="i">counselling</hi> (<hi rend="i"
                >μῆδος</hi>) goddess ; and in the history of Iasôn we find Hera always
              acting in this capacity toward him who, as Homer says<note place="bottom">Od. xii.
                72.</note>, was <hi rend="i">very dear</hi> to her, — an obscure hint perhaps of the
              love of Iasôn and Medeia. Medeia also always acts a friendly part ; and it seems
              highly probable that the atrocities related in the close of her history are pure
              fictions of the Attic dramatists<note place="bottom">Müller, Orchom. <hi rend="i">ut
                  supra.</hi></note>. The bringing of Iasôn and Medeia to Corinth seems also to
              indicate a connexion between the latter and Hera, who was worshiped there under the
              title of Acræa, and the graves of the children of Medeia were in the temple of this
              goddess. It was an annual custom at Corinth that seven youths, and as many maidens,
              children of the most distinguished citizens, clad in black, with their hair shorn,
              should go to this temple, and singing mournful hymns offer sacrifices to appease the
              deity. The cause assigned for this rite was as follows. Medeia reigned at Corinth, but
              the people, disdaining to be governed by an enchantress, conspired against her and
              resolved to put her children (seven of each sex) to death. The children fled to the
              temple of Hera, but they were pursued and slain at the altar. The anger of heaven was
              manifested by a plague, and by the advice of the oracle the expiatory rite above
              mentioned was instituted<note place="bottom">Parmeniscus <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch.
                Eurip. Medeia, 9. 275. Paus. ii. 3, 7. It was said that the Corinthians by a bribe
                of five talents gained Euripides to lay the guilt of the murder of her children on
                Medeia herself. (Schol. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi>)</note>. There was also a
              tradition that Medeia resided at Corinth, and that she caused a famine to cease by
              sacrificing to Demeter and the Lemnian nymphs ; and that Zeus made love to her, but
              she would not hearken to his suit, fearing the anger of Hera, who therefore rewarded
              her by making her children immortal<note place="bottom">Sch. Pind. Ol. xiii.
                74.</note>, — a thing she had vainly attempted to do herself by hiding them in the
              temple of the goddess<note place="bottom">Paus. ii. 3, 11.</note>, whose priestess,
              like Io, she probably was in this mythe.</p>
            <p>It is also remarkable that the only place, besides Corinth, <pb n="312" xml:id="p312"
              />in which there were legends of Medeia, was Corcyra, an island which had been
              colonised by the Corinthians.</p>
            <p>Æetes himself was, according to Eumelos<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Ap.</hi>
                Sch. Pind. Ol. xiii. 74.</note>, the son of Helios and Antiope, and born at Ephyra
              or Corinth, which his sire gave to him ; but he committed the charge of it to Bunos,
              and went to Colchis. It would thus appear that the whole mythe of Æetes and Medeia is
              derived from the worship of the Sun and Hera at Corinth.</p>

            <p>By Ægina the daughter of the river-god Asopos Zeus was the father of Æacos, who dwelt
              in the island named from his mother. The children of Æacos were, Peleus, Telamôn, and
              Phocos. The last having been slain by his brothers out of jealousy, Æacos banished
              them from the island. Peleus fled to Phthia, and was there purified of the murder by
              Eurytiôn the son of Actôr, whose daughter Polymela he married. Being so unfortunate as
              to kill his father-in-law by accident at the Calydonian hunt, he fled to Iolcos, where
              he was purified by Acastos the son of Pelias<note place="bottom">This Welcker (Tril.
                546.) thinks is merely a genealogical fiction.</note>. At the funeral games of
              Pelias he contended with the fair maid Atalanta ; and Hippolyta or Astydameia the wife
              of Acastos beholding fell in love with him, and solicited him by letters, but in vain,
              to gratify her passion. Out of revenge, she then sent to inform his wife that he was
              going to marry Sterope the daughter of Acastos ; and without inquiring into the truth
              of the tale, the credulous Polymela strangled herself. Hippolyta, with the usual
              artifice of a disappointed woman, next accused Peleus to her husband of an attempt on
              her honour<note place="bottom">Pind. Nem. v. 48. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.
              Acastos believed the charge, but not thinking that he could lawfully put to death one
              whom he had purified, invited him to join in a hunt on Mount Pelion. A dispute arising
              there among the hunters about their respective success, Peleus cut out the tongues of
              all the beasts which he killed and put them into his pouch. The companions of Acastos
              getting all these beasts, derided <pb n="313" xml:id="p313"/>Peleus for having killed
              no game ; but pulling out the tongues, he declared that he had killed just so many. He
              fell asleep on Mount Pelion, and Acastos taking his famous sword, which had been made
              by Hephæstos, and hiding it under the cowdung, went away, leaving him there, in hopes

            <p>When the celebrated son of Peleus and Thetis was born, his mother wished to make him

              away what he had inherited of mortal from his father ; and by day she anointed him
              with ambrosia. But Peleus watched, and seeing the child panting in the fire cried out.
              Thetis thus frustrated in her design left her babe, and returned to her
              sister-Nereïdes. Peleus then conveyed the infant to Cheirôn, who reared him on the
              entrails of lions and on the marrow of bears and wild boars, and named him Achilleus,

            <p>Ixiôn was the son of Antiôn or Peisiôn ; others gave him Phlegyas or the god Ares for
              a sire. He obtained the hand of Dia the daughter of Deïoneus, having, according to the
                <pb n="315" xml:id="p315"/>usage of the heroic ages, promised his father-in-law
              large nuptial gifts (<hi rend="i">ἒδνα</hi>) ; but he did not keep his engagement, and
              Deïoneus seized his horses and detained them as a pledge. Ixiôn then sent to say that
              the gifts were ready if he would come to fetch them. Deïoneus accordingly came, but
              his treacherous son-in-law had prepared in his house a pit filled with fire, and
              covered over with bits of wood and dust, into which the unsuspecting prince fell and
              perished. After this deed Ixiôn’s mind became deranged, and its atrocity being such,
              neither gods nor men would absolve him, till at length Zeus himself took pity on him
              and purified him, and admitted him to his house and table on Olympos. But incapable of
              good, Ixiôn cast an eye of desire on the wife of his benefactor and dared to make love
              to her. Hera in concert with her lord formed a cloud in the likeness of herself, which
              Ixiôn embraced. He boasted of his fortune, and Zeus precipitated him to Erebos, where
              Hermes fixed him with brazen bands to an ever-revolving fiery wheel<note

              were subsequently represented. In the fight of the Centaurs and Lapiths on the shield
              of Heracles, the latter appear in panoply fighting with spears, while the former wield
                pine-clubs<note place="bottom">Hes. Shield, 178. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Sec above,

              Centauros, who when grown up wandered about the foot of Pelion, where he copulated
              with the Magnesian mares, who brought forth the Centaurs, a race partaking of the form
              of both parents, their lower parts resembling their dams, the upper their sire.</p>
            <p>By his wife Dia, Ixiôn had a son named Peirithoös, who married Hippodameia daughter
              of Adrastos king of Argos. The chiefs of his own tribe, the Lapiths, were all invited
              to the wedding, as were also the Centaurs, who dwelt in the neighbourhood of Pelion ;
              Theseus, Nestôr, and other strangers, were likewise present. At the feast, Eurytiôn,
              one of the Centaurs, becoming intoxicated with the wine, attempted to offer violence
              to the bride ; the other Centaurs followed his example, and a dreadful conflict arose,
              in which several of them were slain. The Centaurs were finally driven from Pelion, and
              obliged to retire to other regions<note place="bottom">Ovid, Met. xii. 210. <hi

              chiefs to aid them against the Wild-men, whom they routed with great slaughter. From
              all this we may collect the tradition of a protracted conflict between the rude
              Centaurs and the more civilised Lapiths, which ended in the expulsion of the former.
              When Heracles was on his way to hunt the Erymanthian boar, he was entertained by the
              Centaur Pholos ; and this gave rise to a conflict between him and the other Centaurs,
              which terminated in the total discomfiture of the latter<note place="bottom">See

            <p>One of the most celebrated of the Lapiths was Cæneus, who was said to have been
              originally a maiden named Cænis. Poseidôn having violated her, she prayed him as a
              compensation to turn her into a man, and grant that she should be invulnerable<note

            <p>It is the opinion of Buttmann<note place="bottom">Mythologus, ii. 22.</note> that the
              Centaurs and the Lapiths are two purely poetic names, used to designate two opposite
              races of men ; — the former, the rude horse-riding tribes which tradition records to
              have been spread over the north of Greece ; the latter, the more civilised race, which
              founded towns, and gradually drove their wild neighbours back into the mountains. He
              therefore thinks the exposition of Centaurs as <hi rend="i">Air-piercers</hi> (from

              improbable one, for that very idea is suggested by the figure of a Cossack leaning
              forward with his protruded lance as he gallops along. But he regards the idea of <hi

              caused the ruin of both. He called his wife Hera, and was by her styled Zeus in

              of Apollo perished by shipwreck, and that his wife on finding his lifeless body on the
              strand cast herself into the sea. The gods out of compassion changed them both into
              the birds called Halcyôns. During seven days of winter the Halcyôn sits on her eggs,
              and during seven more she feeds her young on the surface of the sea, which then is
              calm and free from storm, and these are called the Halcyôn-days<note place="bottom"

            <p>In this last legend and in all (except the preceding one) relating to him, Ceÿx bears
              a gentle and amiable character.</p>

              The Marriage of Ceÿx (Τ<hi rend="i">άμος</hi> Κ<hi rend="i">ήϋκος</hi>) was a

              which when poisoned by Deïaneira caused the death of the hero, was the gift of

            <p>The fable of Ceÿx and Halcyone is apparently one of those legends, of which we have
              seen so many examples, devised to account for the names, habits, and properties of
              animals. Yet as Ceÿx seems to belong to a very ancient mythic cycle, it is not
              unlikely that it was the resemblance of his name to that of the bird that caused his
              wife to be called Halcyone, and the legend above to be invented.</p>

          <p rend="noindent"><hi rend="sc">The</hi> hero-princes of Calydôn in Ætolia derived their
            origin from Zeus by Protogeneia the daughter of Deucaliôn. Her son, who was named
              Aëthlios<note place="bottom">Aëthlios is the personification of the Olympic
              games.</note>, came at the head of a colony of the Æolids to Elis : he was the father
            of Endymiôn, who enjoyed the love of the goddess Selene. Ætolos, one of the sons of
            Endymiôn by a Naïs, having accidentally killed Apis the son of Phoroneus or Iasôn, fled
            to Curetis, which he named after himself Ætolia. His sons were Pleurôn and Calydôn, who
            built towns of their own name. Agenôr the son of Pleurôn had by Epicaste (the daughter
            of Calydôn) Porthaôn and Demonica ; and Porthaôn was by Euryta (grand-daughter of the
            river-god Acheloös) the father of Agrios, Melas, and Œneus<note place="bottom">Il. xiv.
              115. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> ; for the above genealogy see Apollod. i. 7. 5. <hi

            tradition of Elis having in ancient times received a colony from Thessaly, and also of
            Eleians, or Epeians as they were named, having migrated to Ætolia. This last however may
            be only a late fiction, to give a colour of right to the Ætolian conquest of Elis at the
            time of the Dorian Migration. We may observe that the genuine mythic legends of Calydôn
            have been connected with the ethnographic genealogy.</p>

              two daughters, Gorgo and Deïaneira.</p>

            <p>When Œneus offered sacrifices at the conclusion of his harvest to the gods, he
              omitted to notice Artemis. The offended goddess immediately sent a wild boar of huge
              size and strength to ravage the lands of Calydôn, and destroy the cattle and people. A
              general hunt was proclaimed, and the boar was slain ; but the death of Meleagros the
              brave son of Œneus was the consequence. Althæa did not long survive her son, whose
              death she had caused. After her death Œneus married Peribœa the daughter of Hipponoös,

              his brother (for writers differ), fled to Adrastos at Argos. When Œneus was grown old

                peculiar degree of pleasure. They carried us back from the remote age of the war of
                Troy into a period removed still further in gray antiquity. The pleasure is, to our
                apprehension, something akin to that inspired by the contemplation of very ancient
                ruins. See, however, Appendix (H).</note>, when Phœnix joins his <pb n="322"
                xml:id="p322"/>entreaties to those of Odysseus to prevail on Achilleus to lay aside
              his wrath and aid the Achæans, he quotes the case of Meleagros as an instance of the
              impolicy of not yielding readily and in time : “I remember this event,” says he, “long
              ago, not lately, how it was ; and I will tell it to you all, my friends.”</p>
            <p>He relates the circumstance of the neglect of Artemis by Œneus at his harvest-home
              feast (<hi rend="i">θα</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ύσια</hi>), and her vengeance. Hunters and
              dogs were collected from all sides, and the boar was, with the loss of several lives,
              at length destroyed. A quarrel arose between the Curetes and the Ætolians about the
              head and hide, and a war was the consequence. As long as Meleagros fought, the Curetes
              had the worst of it, and could not keep the field ; but when, enraged at his mother
              Althæa, he remained with his wife the fair Cleopatra and abstained from the war, noise
              and clamour rose about the gates, and the towers of Calydôn were shaken by the
              victorious Curetes : for Althæa, grieved at the fate of her brother, who had fallen in
              the fight, had with tears invoked Aides and Persephoneia to send death to her son.</p>
            <p>The elders of the Ætolians supplicated Meleagros : they sent the priests of the gods

              sisters and his mother supplicated him, but in vain. He remained inexorable, till his
              very chamber was shaken, when the Curetes had mounted the towers and set fire to the
              town. Then his wife besought him with tears, — picturing to him the evils of a
              captured town, the slaughter of the men, the burning of the town, the dragging away
              into captivity of the women and children. Moved by these circumstances, he clad
              himself in arms, went forth, and repelled the enemy ; but not having done it out of
              regard to them, the Ætolians did not give him the proffered recompense.</p>
            <p>Such is the more ancient form of the legend, in which it would appear that the
              Ætolians of Calydôn and the Curetes of Pleurôn alone took part in the hunt. In
              aftertimes, when the vanity of the different states of Greece made them send <pb
                n="323" xml:id="p323"/>their national heroes to every war and expedition of the
              mythic ages, it underwent various modifications.</p>

              him.</p>
            <p>Of the Ætolians there were Meleagros and Dryas son of Ares ; of the Curetes the sons
              of Thestios ; Idas and Lynceus sons of Aphareus came from Messene ; Castôr and
              Polydeukes, sons of Zeus and Leda, from Laconia ; Atalanta daughter of Iasos, and
              Ancæos and Cepheus sons of Lycurgos from Arcadia ; Amphiaraos son of Oïcles from

              Actôr, from Phthia ; Iasôn son of Æsôn from Iolcos ; Admetos son of Pheres from
              Pheræ ; and Peirithoös son of Ixiôn from Larissa<note place="bottom">In the
                ‘Meleagros’ of Euripides there was a long description given of the arms and
                appearance of each of the chiefs. See Fr. Meleag. 6.</note>.</p>
            <p>These chiefs were entertained during nine days in the house of Œneus. On the tenth,
              Cepheus and Ancæos and some others refused to hunt in company with a maiden ; but
              Meleagros, who was in love with Atalanta, obliged them to give over their opposition.
              The hunt began : Ancæos and Cepheus speedily met their fate from the tusks of the
              boar : Peleus accidentally killed Eurytiôn : Atalanta with an arrow gave the monster
              his first wound : Amphiaraos shot him in the eye ; and Meleagros ran him through the
              flanks and killed him. He presented the skin and head to Atalanta ; but the sons of
              Thestios, offended at this preference of a woman, took the skin from her, saying that
              it fell to them of right, on account of their family, if Meleagros resigned his claim
              to it. Meleagros in a rage killed them, and restored the skin to Atalanta.</p>
            <p>When Meleagros was seven days old, the Moiræ, it was said, came, and declared that
              when the billet which was burning on the hearth should be consumed the babe would die.
              Althæa on hearing this snatched the billet, and laid it up carefully in a chest. But
              now her love for her son giving way <pb n="324" xml:id="p324"/>to resentment for the
              death of her brothers, she took the billet from its place of concealment, and cast it
              once more into the flames. As it consumed, the vigour of Meleagros wasted away ; and
              when it was reduced to ashes, his life terminated. Repenting when too late of what she
              had done, Althæa put an end to her life by a cord or a sword. Cleopatra died of
              grief ; and his sisters, who would not be comforted in their affliction, were by the
              compassion of the gods, all but Gorgo and Deïaneira, changed into the birds called
                Meleagrides<note place="bottom">Apollod. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> Nicander, <hi

                  by the billet, was the tragedian Phrynichus in his play of the ‘Pleuronian Women,’
                  from which he quotes the following lines :</p><quote><l>κρυϵρὸν γὰρ

            <p>Two distinct classes of names may be recognised in these Ætolian legends, the one
              relating to agriculture, the other to war. The former are Œneus (<hi rend="i"

              Deïaneira (<hi rend="i">Man’s-foe</hi>), and several others. The former would seem to
              belong to the peaceful rural Pelasgian times, the latter to owe their origin to the

          <p rend="noindent"><hi rend="sc">The</hi> mythology of Bœotia consists of two cycles,
            answering to the natural division of the country. The former belongs to the southern
            part, and chiefly relates to Thebes and the Cadmeians ; the latter to the northern part,
            and Orchomenos and the Minyans. This last cycle is closely connected with that of the
            Argonautics. We shall commence with the cycle of Thebes.</p>

            <p>Poseidôn, says the legend, was by Libya the father of two sons, Belos and Agenôr ;
              the former of whom reigned in Egypt. The latter having gone to Europe married
              Telephassa, by whom he had three sons, Cadmos, Phœnix, and Cilix, and one daughter,
              Europa. Zeus becoming enamoured of Europa carried her away to Crete ; and Agenôr,
              grieving for the loss of his only daughter, ordered his sons to go in quest of her,
              and not to return till they had found her. They were accompanied by their mother and
              by Thasos a son of Poseidôn. Their long search was to no purpose : they could get no
              intelligence of their sister ; and fearing the indignation of their father, they
              resolved to settle in various countries. Phœnix therefore established himself in
              Phœnicia, Cilix in Cilicia ; Cadmos and his mother went to Thrace, where Thasos
              founded a town also named from himself<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 1, 1. This
                genealogy is given somewhat differently by Pherecydes (Sch. Apoll. Rh. iii. 1179.).

            <p>After the death of his mother Cadmos went to Delphi, to inquire of the oracle
              respecting Europa. The god desired him to cease from troubling himself about her, but
              to follow a cow as his guide, and to build a city where she should lie down. On
              leaving the temple he went through Phocis, and meeting a cow belonging to the herds of
              Pelagôn he followed her.</p>
            <pb n="326" xml:id="p326"/><p>She went through Bœotia till she came to where Thebes now
              stands, and there lay down. Wishing to sacrifice her to Athena<note place="bottom">The
                oracle said to Earth. See above, p. 159.</note>, Cadmos sent his companions to fetch
              water from the fount of Ares ; but the fount was guarded by a serpent, who killed the
              greater part of them. Cadmos then engaged with and destroyed the serpent : by the
              direction of Athena he sowed its teeth, and immediately a crop of armed men sprang up,
              who slew each other, either quarrelling or through ignorance : for it is said that
              when Cadmos saw them rising he flung stones at them ; and thinking it was done by some
              of themselves, they fell upon and slew each other. Five only survived ; Echiôn <hi

              >σπάρτοι</hi>) ; and they joined with Cadmos to build the city<note place="bottom"
                >Apollod. iii. 4. Pherecydes <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> This writer says that Ares
                gave the teeth to Cadmos, and desired him to sow them. Hellanicus (<hi rend="i"
                  >ap.</hi> Sch. eund.) says that only the five Spartans were produced from the
                teeth.</note>.</p>
            <p>For killing the sacred serpent Cadmos was obliged to spend a year<note place="bottom"
                  >Α<hi rend="i">ȋδιον ἐνιαυτόν</hi>. “The year then was eight years,” Apollod. Sec
                above, p. 122.</note> in servitude to Ares. At the expiration of that period Athena
              herself prepared for him a palace, and Zeus gave him Harmonia the daughter of Ares and
              Aphrodite in marriage. All the gods, quitting Olympos, celebrated the marriage in the
              Cadmeia, the palace of Cadmos. The bridegroom presented his bride with a magnificent
              robe, and with a collar, the work of Hephæstos, given to him, it is said, by the
              divine artist himself. Harmonia became the mother of four daughters, Semele, Autonoe,
              Ino, and Agaue ; and of one son, Polydoros.</p>
            <p>After the various misfortunes which befel their children, Cadmos and his wife quitted
              Thebes, now grown odious to them, and migrated to the country of the Enchelians ; who,
              being harassed by the incursions of the Illyrians, were told by the oracle that if
              they made Cadmos and Harmonia their leaders they should be successful. They obeyed the
              god, and his prediction was verified. Cadmos became king of the <pb n="327"
                xml:id="p327"/>Illyrians, and had a son named Illyrios. Shortly afterwards he and
              Harmonia were changed into serpents, and sent by Zeus to the Elysian Plain, or, as
              others said, were conveyed thither in a chariot drawn by serpents<note place="bottom"

            <p>The mythe of Cadmos is, by its relation to history, one of considerable importance.
              It is usually regarded as offering a convincing proof of the fact of colonies from the
              East having come to Greece and introduced civilisation and the arts. We will therefore
              here briefly examine it.</p>
            <p>In the Ilias, though the Cadmeians are spoken of more than once<note place="bottom"
                >Il. iv. 390 ; v. 805.</note>, the slightest allusion is not made to Cadmos ; in the
                Odyssey<note place="bottom">Od. v. 333.</note> the sea-goddess Ino-Leucothea is said
              to have been a mortal, and daughter to Cadmos. Hesiod<note place="bottom">Theog. 937.
                975.</note> says that the goddess Harmonia was married to Cadmos in Thebes. Pindar
              frequently speaks of Cadmos ; he places him with the Grecian heroes Peleus and
              Achilleus in the Island of the Blest<note place="bottom">Ol. ii. 142.</note> ; but it
              is very remarkable that this Theban poet never even hints at his Phœnician origin. It
              was however an article of general belief in Pindar's time<note place="bottom">It is
                mentioned, as we have seen, by Pherecydes and Hellanicus.</note>.</p>
            <p>There is a curious coincidence between the name Cadmos and the Semitic term for the
              East, <hi rend="i">Kedem</hi>,<note place="bottom">According to this theory Cadmeians
                would signify Eastmen or Ostmen, the name the Scandinavians gave themselves in
                Ireland. But these left traces at least of their language.</note>, and this may in
              reality be the sole foundation for the notion of a Phœnician colony at Thebes ; for
              none of the usual evidences of colonisation are to be found. We do not, for example,
              meet with the slightest trace of Phœnician influence in the language, manners, or
              institutions of Bœotia. It is further a thing most incredible, that a seafaring
              commercial people like the Phœnicians should have selected as the site of their very
              earliest foreign settlement a place situated in a rich fertile valley away from the
              sea, and only adapted for agriculture, without mines, or any of those objects of trade
              which might tempt a people <pb n="328" xml:id="p328"/>of that character. It is also
              strange that the descendents of these colonists should have so entirely put off the
              Phœnician character as to become noted in after-ages for their dislike of trade of
              every kind. We may therefore, we think, now venture to dismiss this theory and seek a
              Grecian origin for Cadmos<note place="bottom">See Müller, Orchom. 113. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Homer and Hesiod call the people of Thebes Cadmeians or Cadmeionians, and the country
              the Cadmeian land<note place="bottom">Κ<hi rend="i">αδμηḯδι γαίῃ.</hi> Hes. W. and
                D. 162.</note> ; the citadel was at all times named the Cadmeia. Cadmos is therefore
              apparently (like Pelasgos, Doros, Iôn, Thessalos, and so many others,) merely a
              personification of the name of the people. Here then we might stop, and leave the
              Cadmeians to rank with the Ionians, Thessalians and others, of whose name it is
              difficult to assign a probable origin. It is however said that Cadmos signifies <hi
                rend="i">Prince</hi> or <hi rend="i">General</hi>, that Cadmeia is therefore <hi
                rend="i">Palace</hi>, and that the people thence derived their name<note
                place="bottom">Welcker, Kret. Kol. 22. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Κ<hi rend="i"
                  >άδμοѕ</hi>, from <hi rend="i">кάζω, to adorn</hi> or <hi rend="i">order.</hi> He
                as usual gives a profusion of cognate terms. The word Κ<hi rend="i">άδμοѕ</hi> he
                regards as exaetly answering to <hi rend="i">кόσμοѕ</hi>, the name of the chief
                magistrate in Crete.</note>, — a case we believe contrary to all analogy. Again, we
              are reminded that Cadmilos or Cadmos was a name of Hermes in the mysteries of
              Samothrace, which were instituted by the Tyrrhenian Pelasgians, who, at the time of
              the Dorian migration being driven from Bœotia, settled on the islands in the north of
              the Ægæan. We are further reminded that the name Cadmos occurs only at Thebes and
              Samothrace ; that Harmonia was an object of worship in this last place, and that the
              Cabeiræan deities were also worshiped at Thebes. Hence it is inferred that
              Cadmos-Hermes, <hi rend="i">i. e.</hi> Hermes <hi rend="i">Regulator</hi> or <hi
                rend="i">Disposer</hi>, a cosmogonie power, gave name to a portion of the Pelasgian
              race, and that in the usual manner the god was made a mortal king<note place="bottom"

            <p>We must confess that this ingenious theory fails to convince us, and we are inclined
              to think that it was the circumstance of Cadmos (the personified Cadmeians) happening
              also to signify the <hi rend="i">Regulator</hi>, that gave rise to all this mystery
                <pb n="329" xml:id="p329"/>in which he is enveloped. It was certainly his name that
              led to the idea of giving him Harmonia for his bride. The influence of names is also
              we think perceptible in the oracle given to the Enchelians, namely to take Cadmos and
              Harmonia for their leaders, that is, to adopt regular discipline, and they would be
              victorious in war. The name of this people (Ἐ<hi rend="i">γχέλεις, eels</hi>) may have
              had its effect on the legend of the change of Cadmos and Harmonia into serpents.</p>
            <p>By the Spartans (<hi rend="i">Sown</hi>) in this legend are probably meant the
              Eupatrids, or ancient nobility of Thebes, of which there may have been only five
              Houses (<hi rend="i">γένεα</hi>). As such were fond of representing themselves as
              Autochthons, and the serpent was the symbol of constant residence<note place="bottom"
                >Herod. i. 78.</note>, and the teeth might represent military prowess, the legend of
              the serpent slain by Cadmos may be interpreted in a political sense, of the conquest
              of the country and the origin of the Theban patricians<note place="bottom">See Welcker
                  <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> 78. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>It is rather remarkable that the names of the children of Cadmos seem all to refer to
              the element of water. Ino is a goddess of the sea, Agaue and Autonoe occur in the list
              of the Nereïdes, and Polydora is the name of an Ocean-nymph<note place="bottom">Hes.
                Th. 246. 258. 354.</note>. Semele herself may refer to the <hi rend="i"

            <p>Semele, the daughter of Cadmos, enjoyed the fatal honour of the love of Zeus. The

            <p>Autonoe was married to Aristæos, the son of Apollo by the nymph Cyrene, the daughter
              of Hypseus son of the river-god <pb n="330" xml:id="p330"/>Peneios, and king of the
              Lapiths of Thessaly. Cyrene was averse from all feminine occupations, and passed her
              days in hunting the wild beasts, and thus protecting the cattle of her father. One day
              as she was engaged in combat with a lion, Apollo beheld her, and filled with
              admiration of her beauty and her courage, he called out to Cheirôn to quit his cave
              and come to look at her. To the questions of the god respecting her the Centaur
              replied, by informing him that he was to be her spouse, and to carry her in his golden
              car over the sea to the rich garden of Zeus, where Libya would joyfully receive her in
              a golden abode ; that there she would bear a son, whom Hermes would take to the
              ‘well-seated Seasons and Earth,’ who would feed him with nectar and ambrosia, and
              render him immortal ; and that he should be called Zeus, and holy Apollo, Agreus (<hi
                rend="i">Hunter</hi>), and Nomios (<hi rend="i">Herdsman</hi>), and Aristæos. The
              god forthwith seized the nymph and in his car drawn by swans<note place="bottom"
                >Pherecydes <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch. Apoll. Rh. ii. 498.</note> conveyed her to

              breezes breathed over the isle, and the evil departed. After his death he was deified

              for Eurydice the wife of Orpheus ; his pursuit of her, and her unfortunate death ; on
              which the Napæan nymphs, her companions, destroyed all his bees ; and the mode adopted
              by him on the advice of his mother to stock once more his hives.</p>
            <p>Actæôn was the offspring of the marriage of Aristæos with Autonoe. He was reared by
              Cheirôn, and becoming <pb n="331" xml:id="p331"/>passionately devoted to the chase,
              passed his days chiefly in pursuit of the wild beasts that haunted Mount Cithærôn. One
              sultry day, as he rambled alone, he chanced to surprise Artemis and her nymphs as they
              were bathing. The goddess, incensed at his intrusion, flung some water upon him and
              turned him into a stag. She also inspired with madness the fifty dogs that were with
              him, and they ran down and devoured their unhappy master. They then went about whining
              in quest of him, till they came at last to the cave of Cheirôn, who appeased their
              grief by making an image of Actæôn<note place="bottom">Callim. v. 107. <hi rend="i"

            <p>Aristæos, it is quite evident from the names given him by Pindar, was an original
              deity, Zeus-Aristæos, or Aristos, or Apollo-Agreus, or Nomios. He was a rural god,
              presiding over cattle and game, the culture of the vine and olive, and especially the
              management of bees. The chief seats of his worship were Arcadia<note place="bottom"
                >Virg. Geor. iv. 283. Nonnus, xiii. 275. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> (whence it
              was carried over to Ceos), Thessaly<note place="bottom">Apoll. Rh. iii. 514.</note>,
              and as this was inhabited by the Minyans, some of whom were among the colonists to
              Cyrene, it was taken thither ; and finally Bœotia, whence we find him united to one of
              the daughters of Cadmos<note place="bottom">Müller, Orchom. 348.</note>. Apollo was
              also an object of especial veneration to the settlers at Cyrene ; and in the oldest
              part of the city there was a fount named Cyre, sacred to him, whence perhaps came the
              name of the town itself<note place="bottom">Herod. iv. 158.</note>. It was moreover a
              habit of the early Greek colonies to fancy or feign that in the mythic ages their
              patron-gods or heroes had already taken possession of the place in which they were now
              settled under their auspices and protection<note place="bottom">Müller, Proleg.
                143.</note>. In no place were there more of these traditions than in <pb n="332"
                xml:id="p332"/>Cyrene, and hence arose the mythe of Apollo's carrying the nymph
              Cyrene from the foot of Pelion, and having by her a son named Aristæos.</p>
            <p>The mythe of Actæôn may be thus explained. On the summit of Pelion stood a temple of
                Zeus-Actæos<note place="bottom">So named probably from the Δ<hi rend="i">ημήτϵροѕ
                  άкτή</hi>. See Welcker in Schwenk. 305.</note>, to which, when the dog-days began,
              a party of noble youths selected by the priest ascended clad in fresh-stript
              sheep-skins to protect them from the cold, and there sacrificed to the god to avert
              the evil influence of the dog-star<note place="bottom">Dicæarchus in the Geograph.
                Minor. ii. 29.</note>. Now Actæôn’s father Aristæos had done just the same at Ceos,
              and this shows a connexion between their mythes, that in fact they were two epithets
              of the same god. The fifty hounds of Actæôn answer to the fifty dog-days. One
                account<note place="bottom">Stesichorus <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi></note> said that
              Artemis threw a stag's-hide over him, and thus caused the error of his dogs, and this
              might refer to the sheep-skins ; the cave of Cheirôn was on Mount Pelion. The tale of
              the image may perhaps be connected with the following legend. There was an image in a
              rock that caused injury to the land of Orchomenos ; the oracle of Delphi, on being
              consulted, directed that whatever was remaining of Actæôn should be hidden in the
              earth, and a brazen figure of that image be made, and bound with iron to the rock, and
              that then the evil would cease<note place="bottom">Paus. ix. 38, 5.</note>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Ino was married to Athamas, son of Æolos, and king of Orchomenos.</p>
            <p>Athamas, it is said, had been already married to Nephele (<hi rend="i">Cloud</hi>),
              by whom he had two children, Phrixos and Helle. He then espoused Ino the daughter of
              Cadmos, who bore him two sons, Learchos and Melicertes. Ino feeling the usual jealousy
              of a step-mother, resolved to destroy the children of Nephele. For this purpose she
              persuaded the women to parch the seed-corn unknown to their husbands. They did as she
              desired, and the lands consequently yielded no crop. Athamas sent to Delphi to consult
              the oracle how the threatening <pb n="333" xml:id="p333"/>famine might be averted. Ino
              persuaded the messengers to say that Apollo directed Phrixos to be sacrificed to Zeus.
              Compelled by his people Athamas reluctantly placed his son before the altar ; but
              Nephele snatched away both her son and her daughter, and gave them a gold-fleeced ram
              she had obtained from Hermes, which carried them through the air over sea and land.
              They proceeded safely till they came to the sea between Sigeion and the Chersonese,
              into which Helle fell, and it was named from her Hellespontos (<hi rend="i">Helle's
                Sea</hi>). Phrixos went on to Colchis, to Æetes the son of Helios, who received him
              kindly, and gave him in marriage Chalciope his daughter. He there sacrificed his ram
              to Zeus Phyxios, and gave the golden fleece to Æetes, who nailed it to an oak in the
              grove of Ares.</p>
            <p>Athamas, through the enmity of Hera to Ino, who had suckled the infant Dionysos, was
              afterwards seized with madness. In his phrensy he shot his son Learchos with an arrow,
              or, as others say, dashed him to pieces against a rock. Ino fled with her other son ;
              and being closely pursued by her furious husband, sprang with her child from the cliff
              of Moluris near Corinth into the sea. The gods took pity on her and made her a
              sea-goddess under the name of Leucothea, and Melicertes a sea-god under that of
                Palæmôn<note place="bottom">See above, p. 249.</note>.</p>
            <p>Athamas, being obliged to leave Bœotia, inquired of the god where he should settle.
              He was told to establish himself in the place where he should be entertained by the
              wild beasts. Having wandered over many lands, he came one day to where some wolves
              were devouring the thighs of sheep. At the sight of him they fled, abandoning their
              prey. Judging this to be the fulfilment of the oracle, he settled in this place, built
              a town which he named from himself Athamantia ; and marrying Themisto the daughter of
              Hypseus, had by her four children, Leucôn, Erythroe, Schœneus, and Ptoös<note
                place="bottom">Apollod. i. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is thus that we find this important mythe related by Apollodorus. There are
              however many variations in the tale. Thus it is said that Ino was Athamas’ first wife,
              and that he put her away by the direction of Hera and married Nephele, who left him
              after she had borne two children, on finding that he still <pb n="334" xml:id="p334"
              />kept up an intercourse with Ino. When the response of the oracle came to Athamas he
              sent for Phrixos out of the country, desiring him to come and to bring the finest
              sheep in the flock for a sacrifice. The ram then spoke with a human voice to Phrixos
              warning him of his danger, and offering to carry him and his sister to a place of
              safety. The ram, it was added, died at Colchis<note place="bottom">Philostephanos, <hi
                  rend="i">ap.</hi> Schol. II. vii. 86.</note>. It was also said that the flight of
              Phrixos was caused by his rejection of the amorous advances of his step-mother or his
                aunt<note place="bottom">Hygin. P. A. ii. 20.</note>, and again that in the time of
              dearth he offered himself as a voluntary victim.</p>
            <p>It has been already observed that the tragic poets allowed themselves great liberties
              in their treatment of the ancient mythes. There is none which has suffered more at
              their hands than the present one, for it was a favourite subject with them. Thus
              Euripides in his Ino said that Athamas thinking that Ino had perished in the woods
              married Themisto ; but Ino, who was alive, came and lived as a maid-servant unknown in
              the house of Athamas. Here Themisto made her the confidant of her design to destroy
              Ino's children, and directed her for that purpose to dress <hi rend="i">them</hi> in
              black and her own in white, that she might be able to distinguish them. Ino however
              reversed the orders, and Themisto unwittingly killed her own children, and then seeing
              what she had done slew herself<note place="bottom">Hygin. 4. Nonnus, ix. 247. <hi

            <p>We will now endeavour to point out the meaning of this very obscure legend. Athamas
              it is plain belonged to the Minyans, who dwelt in Bœotia and about the bay of Pagasæ
              in Thessaly. At Alos in this last region stood a temple of Laphystian<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Flight-giving</hi> ; λ<hi rend="i">αϕύσσω</hi> is the
                same as <hi rend="i">σπϵύδω, ϕϵύγω.</hi></note> Zeus, about which there was the
              following tradition<note place="bottom">Herod. vii. 127.</note>. To punish the crime
              of Athamas the oracle directed that the eldest person of his posterity should abstain
              from entering the Prytaneion or senate-house, or if found there should be offered as a
              sacrifice. Many of those in this situation fled the country, and such as returned and
              were caught <pb n="335" xml:id="p335"/>in the Prytaneion were led forth to sacrifice
              bound with woollen fillets. These persons were said to be the descendents of
              Kytissoros the son of Phrixos, who had come from Colchis and saved his grandfather
              Athamas, when the people were about to sacrifice him as a sin-offering by command of
              the oracle. By this act Kytissoros had drawn the anger of the gods on his
              posterity.</p>
            <p>It is not unlikely then that this mythe of Athamas took its rise from the
              sin-offering (<hi rend="i">κάθαρμα</hi>), a real or symbolic human sacrifice which
              prevailed in various parts of Greece ; and of which this was the most sublime form, as
              it represented not criminals, as elsewhere, but the noblest members of society, the
              descendents of Zeus himself, expiating by their lives for the sin not of themselves
              but of the people<note place="bottom">See Müller, Orchom. 161. <hi rend="i"

            <p>Agaue, the remaining daughter of Cadmos, was married to Echiôn, one of the Spartans.
              Her son Pentheus succeeded his grandfather in the government over Thebes. During his
              reign, Dionysos came from the East and sought to introduce his orgies into his native
              city. The women all gave enthusiastically into the new religion, and Mount Cithærôn
              rang to the frantic yells of the Bacchantes. Pentheus sought to check the phrensy ;
              but, deceived by the god, he went secretly and ascended a tree on Cithærôn to be an
              ocular witness of the revels. While there he was descried by his mother and aunts, to
              whom Dionysos made him appear to be a wild beast, and he was torn to pieces by

            <p>After the death of Pentheus Thebes was governed by <pb n="336" xml:id="p336"
              />Polydoros the son of Cadmos, who married Nycteïs the daughter of Nycteus. Their son
              was Labdacos, who on succeeding his father opposed himself like Pentheus to the
              religion of Dionysos, and underwent a similar fate. As his son Laïos was but a year
              old, the throne was occupied by Lycos the brother of Nycteus.</p>
            <p>Both Lycos and his brother, it is said, had fled from Eubœa for killing Phlegyas the
              son of Ares ; and as they were related to Pentheus, he enrolled them among the
              citizens of Thebes. Lycos on the death of Labdacos was chosen polemarch by the
              Thebans ; and he seized the regal power, which he occupied for twenty years, till he
              was killed by Zethos and Amphiôn.</p>
            <p>These were the sons of Zeus by Antiope the daughter of Nycteus. Terrified at the
              threats of her father when the consequences of her frailty became apparent, Antiope
              fled to Sicyôn, where she married Epopeus. Nycteus out of grief put an end to himself,
              having previously charged his brother Lycos to punish Epopeus and Antiope. Lycos
              accordingly marched an army against Sicyôn, took it, slew Epopeus, and led Antiope
              away captive. On the way to Thebes she brought forth twins at Eleutheræ. The unhappy
              babes were exposed on the mountain ; but a neatherd having found them, reared them,
              calling the one Zethos, the other Amphiôn. The former devoted himself to the care of
              cattle ; the latter passed his time in the practice of music, having been presented
              with a lyre and taught to play on it by Hermes.</p>
            <p>Meantime Lycos had put Antiope in bonds, and she was treated with the utmost cruelty
              by him and his wife Dirce. But her chains loosed of themselves, and she fled to the
              dwelling of her sons in search of shelter and protection. Having recognised her, they
              resolved to avenge her wrongs : they attacked and slew Lycos, and tying Dirce by the
              hair to a bull let him drag her till she was dead : they then cast her body into the
              fount which was named from her. They expelled Laïos, seized on the government, and
              walled-in the town ; for which purpose the stones are said to have moved in obedience
              to the lyre of Amphiôn.</p>
            <p>Zethos married Thebe, from whom he named the town. Amphiôn espoused Niobe the
              daughter of Tantalos, who bore <pb n="337" xml:id="p337"/>him an equal number of sons
              and daughters. Elated with her numerous progeny she set herself above Leto, who was
              the mother of but two children ; the latter complained to Apollo and Artemis, and the
              sons of Niobe soon fell by the arrows of the former, while her daughters perished by
              those of his sister.</p>

            <p>Some however think that in this story of the Antiopids glimpses are given of the
              ancient political state of Thebes. It is observed that there is no connexion between
              them and the Cadmic line ; that given above being plainly the work of late times to
              account for their appearance at Thebes. Müller<note place="bottom">Orchom. 227. <hi
                  rend="i">seq.</hi></note> views in the former a race of priest-kings devoted to
              the service of Demeter and Hermes-Cadmos, while the two ‘white-horsed gods’<note
                place="bottom">Eur. Phœn. 615.</note> were gallant warriors who walled and fortified
              the city for the defence, it is said<note place="bottom">Pherecydes, <hi rend="i"

              warlike Phlegyans. In fine this writer would seem to view in ancient Thebes a
              political state of things somewhat similar to that in France under the last
              Merovingians, or still more resembling that of Japan at the present day.
                Welcker's<note place="bottom">Kret. Kol. 82. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> views are
              not very dissimilar. He sees in the story of the Twins a <hi rend="i">Diarchy</hi>, as
              at Sparta and at Rome in its origin, and he conceives it to have been established by
              one of the ancient houses, as Nycteus is called the son of Chthonios. He also
              discovers that the Antiopids favoured the religion of Dionysos, to which the Cadmeians
              were so hostile ; in Amphiôn’s love of music and union with Niobe he finds evidence of
              the early introduction of the Lydian melody into Thebes.</p>

            <p>Laïos, when driven from Thebes by the Antiopids, retired to the Peloponnese, where he
              was entertained by Pelops, whose son Chrysippos he instructed in the art of driving a
              chariot. On the death of Amphiôn he succeeded to the throne of Thebes ; and he married
              the daughter of Menœceus, called by Homer Epicasta, by others Iocasta. The oracle
              however warned him against having children, declaring that he would meet his death by
              means of his offspring. He long abstained from his wife : at length, having one time
              drunk too much wine on a solemn occasion, his love overcame his prudence, and Iocasta
              gave birth to a son, whom his father delivered to his herdsman to expose on Mount
              Cithærôn. The herdsman, moved to compassion, according to one account<note
                place="bottom">Soph. Œd. Tyr. 1038.</note>, gave the babe to a neatherd belonging to
              Polybos king of Corinth ; or, as others say, the neatherds of Polybos found the infant
              after it had been exposed, and brought it to Peribœa the wife of Polybos, who being
              childless reared it as her own, and named it Œdipûs on account of its <hi rend="i"

              pierced its heels. Many years afterwards Laïos, being on his way to Delphi accompanied
              only by his herald Polyphontes, met in a narrow road in Phocis a young man also
              driving in a chariot. On his refusal to leave the way at their command, the herald
              killed one of his horses ; and the stranger, filled with rage, slew both Laïos and his
              herald, and then pursued his journey. The body of Laïos was found and honourably
              buried by Damasistratos king of Platæa ; and Creôn the son of Menœceus occupied the

            <p>The foundling Œdipûs was brought up by Polybos as his heir. Happening to be
              reproached by some one at a banquet with being a supposititious child, he besought
              Peribœa to inform him of the truth ; but unable to get any satisfaction from her, he
              went to Delphi and consulted the oracle. The <pb n="341" xml:id="p341"/>god directed
              him to shun his native country, or he should be the slayer of his father and the
              sharer of his mother's bed. He therefore resolved never to return to Corinth, where so
              much crime as he thought awaited him, and he took his road through Phocis. He it was
              who encountered Laïos, and unwittingly accomplished the former part of the oracle.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the death of Laïos, Hera, always hostile to the city of Dionysos,
              sent to afflict Thebes a monster named the Sphinx<note place="bottom"><p>The Sphinx is
                  not mentioned by Homer ; but the legend is noticed in the Theogony (v. 326.),
                  where she is called Ф<hi rend="i">ῖξ</hi>. Though this legend is probably older
                  than the time of the first intercourse with Egypt, the Theban monster bears a
                  great resemblance to the symbolical statues placed before the temples of that land
                  of mystery.</p><p>In the <hi rend="i">pragmatising</hi> days it was said (Paus.
                  Ix. 26.) that the Sphinx was a female pirate, who used to land at Anthedôn and
                  advance to the Phicean Hill, whence she spread her ravages over the country.
                  Œdipûs came from Corinth with a numerous army, and defcated and slew
                her.</p></note>, sprung from Typhôn and Echidna. She had the face of a woman ; the
              breast, feet, and tail of a lion ; and the wings of a bird. She had been taught
              riddles by the Muses, and she sat on the Phicean Hill and propounded one to the
              Thebans. It was this : “What is that which has one voice, is four-footed, two-footed,
              and at last three-footed ?” The oracle told the Thebans that they would not be
              delivered from her until they had solved her riddle. They often met to try their
              skill ; and when they failed, the Sphinx carried off and devoured one of their number.
              At length his son Hæmôn having become her victim, Creôn offered by public proclamation
              the throne and the hand of his sister Iocasta to whoever should solve the riddle of
              the Sphinx. Œdipûs, who was then at Thebes, hearing this, came forward and answered
              the Sphinx, that it was a Man ; who when an infant creeps on all fours, when a man
              goes on two feet, and when old uses a staff, a third foot. The Sphinx flung herself
              down to the earth and perished ; and Œdipûs now unknowingly accomplished the remainder
              of the oracle. He had by his mother two sons, Eteocles and Polyneices, and two
              daughters, Antigone and Ismene.</p>
            <p>After some years Thebes was afflicted with famine and pestilence ; and the oracle
              being consulted, desired the land to be purified of the blood which defiled it.
              Inquiry was set on <pb n="342" xml:id="p342"/>foot after the murderer of Laïos, and a
              variety of concurring circumstances brought the guilt home to Œdipûs. Iocasta, on the
              discovery being made, ended her days by a cord, and her unhappy son and husband in his
              grief and despair put out his eyes. He was banished from Thebes ; and accompanied by
              his daughters, who faithfully adhered to him, after a tedious period of miserable
              wandering he arrived at the grove of the Erinnyes, at Colonos, a village not far from
              Athens, and there found the termination of his wretched life<note place="bottom"

            <p>Such is the form in which the story of Œdipûs has been transmitted to us by the Attic
              dramatists. We will now consider its more ancient forms.</p>
            <p>The hero of the Odyssey says, “I saw (in Erebos) the mother of Œdipodes, the fair
              Epicaste, who in her ignorance did an awful deed, marrying her own son ; and <hi
                rend="i">he</hi> married having slain his own father, and immediately the gods made
              this known to men. But <hi rend="i">he</hi> ruled over the Cadmeians in desirable
              Thebes, suffering woes through the pernicious counsels of the gods ; but <hi rend="i"
                >she</hi> oppressed with grief went to the abode of Aïdes, the strong gate-keeper,
              having fastened a long halter to the lofty roof, and left to <hi rend="i">him</hi>
              many woes, such as the Erinnyes of a mother produce.” In the Ilias<note place="bottom"
                >Il. xxiii. 679. The word <hi rend="i">δϵδουπότοѕ</hi> is rather ambiguous, but it
                is probably merely <hi rend="i">dead.</hi> See Il. i. 191.</note> the funeral games
              are mentioned which were celebrated at Thebes in honour of the ‘fallen Œdipodes’.
                Hesiod<note place="bottom">Works, 162.</note> speaks of the heroes who fell fighting
              at the seven-gated Thebes on account of the sheep of Œdipodes. It would also seem
              that, according to the above passage of the Odyssey, and to the epic poem the
                Œdipodeia<note place="bottom">Paus. ix. 5, 11. Pherecydes (Sch. Phœn. 52.) said that
                the sons of Iocasta were Phrastôr and Laonytos, who fell in battle against the
                Minyans. When the year (of mourning for Iocasta ?) was ended, he adds, Œdipûs
                married Eurygeneia, and on her death Astymedusa the daughter of Sthenelos.</note>,
              Epicasta had not any children by her son, Eurygeneia the daughter of Hyperphas being
              the mother of his wellknown children. According to the cyclic Thebaïs<note
                place="bottom">Athen. xi. 465.</note>, the fatal <pb n="343" xml:id="p343"/>curse of
              Œdipûs on his sons had the following origin. Polyneices placed before his father a
              silver table which had belonged to Cadmos, and filled a golden cup with wine for him ;
              but when he perceived the heir-looms of his family thus set before him, he raised his
              hands and prayed that his sons might never divide their inheritance peaceably, but
              ever be at strife. Elsewhere the Thebaïs<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Ap.</hi>
                Sch. Soph. Œd. Col. 1440.</note> said that his sons having sent him the loin instead
              of the shoulder of the victim, he flung it to the ground, and prayed that they might
              fall by each other's hands. The motives assigned by the tragedians are certainly of a
              more dignified nature than these, which seem trifling and insignificant. This story
              affords convincing proof of the great liberties which the Attic tragedians allowed
              themselves to take with the ancient mythes. It was purely to gratify Athenian vanity
              that Sophocles, contrary to the current tradition, made Œdipûs die at Colonos ; his
              blindness seems also a tragic fiction. Euripides makes Iocasta survive her sons, and
              terminate her life by the sword<note place="bottom">See below, <hi rend="i">Theban

            <p>In all the unhappy history of the Labdacids at Thebes this celebrated soothsayer
              occupies a distinguished place ; and his fame was apparently widely extended in the
              most remote times. Circe tells the hero of the Odyssey, when anxious to return to
              Ithaca, that he must previously ‘seek the dwelling of Aides and awful Persephoneia, to
              consult the soul of the Theban Teiresias, the blind prophet, whose mental powers are
              perfect ; to whom, though dead, Persephoneia has granted reason, that he alone should
              have sense while others flit about mere shades<note place="bottom">Od. x.
              490.</note>.’ When Odysseus afterwards goes to the abode of Aides, Teiresias
              approaches him bearing his golden staff ; and he alone of the dead recognises the
              mortal hero before he has tasted the blood ; of which, however, he drinks previous to
              revealing to him the future<note place="bottom">Od. xi. 90.</note>.</p>
            <p>Teiresias is said to have been the son of Eueres and the <pb n="344" xml:id="p344"
              />nymph Chariclo, of the race of Udæos, one of the Spartans (<hi rend="i">Sown</hi>).
              Various accounts are given as to the cause of his blindness : one ascribes it to his
              having seen Athena bathing<note place="bottom">Pherecyd. <hi rend="i">ap.</hi>

              Cithærôn, killed the female, and was suddenly changed into a woman. In this state he
              continued seven years ; at the end of which period, observing two serpents similarly
              engaged, he killed the male, and thus returned to his pristine state. On some occasion
              Zeus and Hera fell into a dispute, whether the greater portion of the pleasures of
              love fall to man or woman. Unable to settle it to their satisfaction, they agreed to
              refer the matter to Teiresias, who had known either state. His answer was that of ten
              parts but one falls to man<note place="bottom"><quote><l> Οἲην μὲν μοίραν δéкα

              the power of vision. Zeus, as one god cannot undo the acts of another, gave him in
              compensation an extent of life for seven generations, and the power of foreseeing
              coming events.</p>
            <p>Teiresias lived at Thebes, where he was contemporary with all the events of the times
              of Laïos and Œdipûs, and the two Theban wars. At the conclusion of the last he
              recommended the Thebans to abandon their city, and he was the companion of their
              flight. It was still night when they arrived at the fountain of Tilphussa. Teiresias,
              whose period of life was fated to be coextensive with that of the city of the
              Cadmeians, drank of its waters, and immediately died. The victorious Argives sent his
              daughter Manto along with a portion of the spoil to Delphi, according to the vow which
              they had made. In obedience to the command of the oracle, Manto afterwards went
              thence, and marrying Rhakios of Mycenæ or Crete, founded the town and oracle of
              Claros. She bore to Rhakios, <pb n="345" xml:id="p345"/>(or, as others said, to
              Apollo) a son named Mopsos, a celebrated prophet<note place="bottom">The Thebaïs <hi

            <p>No names are more completely buried in the depths of mythology than those of the
              Minyans and Phlegyans. Even to Homer but a slight breath of their fame seems to have
                come<note place="bottom">Homer never mentions the Minyans ; but he uses the
                adjective Minyan as an appellative of the wealthy city Orchomenos in Bœotia to
                distinguish it from that in Arcadia, and he also (Il. xi. 722.) applies it to a
                stream in the Peloponnese. He speaks (Il. xiii. 302.) of the Phlegyans.</note>.</p>
            <p>Pausanias<note place="bottom">Paus. ix. 34. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> relates,
              that the country about Orchomenos in Bœotia was first possessed by Andreus, the son of
              the river Peneios, who named it from himself Andreïs. He was succeeded by his son
              Eteocles, who is said to have been the first who sacrificed to the Graces. Eteocles
              gave a portion of his territory to Halmos the son of Sisyphos of Corinth, to whose
              posterity, on Eteocles’ dying childless, the kingdom came : for Halmos had two
              daughters, Chrysogeneia and Chryse ; the former of whom was by Ares mother of
              Phlegyas ; the latter bore to Poseidôn a son named Minyas<note place="bottom"
                >According to Pausanias, the son of Chryse was Chryses the father of Minyas ; but
                the authors followed by the scholiast on Apollonius (iii. 1094.) give the more
                probable genealogy of the text.</note>. Phlegyas <pb n="346" xml:id="p346"/>obtained
              the dominion after Eteocles, and named the country Phlegyantis. He also built a city
              called Phlegya, into which he collected the bravest warriors of Greece. These
              separated themselves from the other people of the country, and took to robbing and
              plundering. They even ventured to assail and burn the temple of Delphi ; and Zeus, on
              account of their impiety, finally destroyed them with lightning and pestilence. A few
              only escaped to Phocis.</p>
            <p>Minyas reigned next, and was wealthier than any of his predecessors. He built the
              first treasury, similar to that of Atreus at Mycenæ. Pausanias saw the ruins of it,
              and describes it as being of great size and strength. The son of Minyas was
              Orchomenos, who gave name to the town ; and with him the race of Halmos ended, and the
              territory fell to the descendents of Athamas and Phrixos. Clymenos, one of these,
              having been slain in a quarrel with the Thebans at the feast of Poseidôn at Onchestos,
              his son Erginos made war on them, and reduced them to an annual tribute, which they
              paid till relieved from it by Heracles. Erginos was father of the celebrated
              architects Agamedes and Trophonios. Two of this family, Ascalaphos and Ialmenos, were
              at the siege of Troy, and with them ends the mythic history of Orchomenos.</p>
            <p>The Argonauts were called Minyans, according to the mythologists, because the greater
              part of them were descended from Minyas on the female side<note place="bottom">Apoll.
                Rh. i. 229.</note> ; and the daughters of Minyas are celebrated in the mythe of
              Dionysos, on account of their contempt for his rites, and their consequent
                punishment<note place="bottom">See above, p. 213.</note>.</p>
            <p>The subject of the Minyans has been treated at great length by Müller<note
                place="bottom">Orchom. 133. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note> and Buttmann<note
                place="bottom">Mytholog. ii. 194. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. The result of their
              inquiries is as follows.</p>
            <p>The Minyans was the mythic name of one of the early races of Greece, probably a
              portion of the Æolian. They inhabited the northern part of Bœotia and the southern of
              Thessaly, and practised and acquired considerable wealth by commerce and navigation ;
              this is denoted by the names derived from <hi rend="i">gold</hi>
              <pb n="347" xml:id="p347"/>which occur in their genealogy, by Poseidôn’s forming a
              part of it, and by the tradition of the great wealth of Orchomenos. Their port was
              Iolcos, and their dock-yard Pagasæ. The Argonautic expedition was one undertaken by
              them ; and the assemblage of the heroes from all parts of Greece was the addition of
              later times, which also assigned the wrong origin of the name Minyans given to the
              heroes, which we have just mentioned. It is a remarkable fact, that Orchomenos was one
              of the seven cities which had a share in the Amphictyonic assembly on the Argolic
              island Calauria. The remaining six were states in the neighbourhood ; and nothing but
              superior wealth and naval power could have induced them to admit the distant
              Orchomenos into their association. Everything conspires, they think, to prove, that
              the whole of the Ægæan coast of Greece, especially that possessed by the Minyans,
              carried on an active commerce by sea at a period long anterior to history.</p>
            <p>The Phlegyans, whose name corresponds with their fate, are by Buttmann regarded as
              belonging to the universal tradition of an impious people being destroyed by fire from
              heaven, — the well-known history of the origin of the Dead Sea, which, as the legend
              of Baucis and Philemôn might seem to show, early made its way into Greece. Müller
              regards the Phlegyans as being the same with the Lapiths and the military class of the
              Minyans. It was probably their name which gave occasion to the legend of their
                destruction<note place="bottom">The Phlegyans were probably the <hi rend="i"

            <p>When Erginos, king of Orchomenos, had been overcome by Heracles, his affairs fell
              into such a reduced state, that in order to retrieve them he abstained from matrimony.
              As he grew rich and old, he wished to have children ; and going to Delphi, he
              consulted the god, who gave him in oracular phrase the prudent advice to marry a young
                wife<note place="bottom">Paus. ix. 37, 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>Erginos accordingly following the counsel of the Pythia, <pb n="348" xml:id="p348"
              />married, and had two sons, Trophonios and Agamedes ; though some said Apollo was the
              father of the former. They became distinguished architects, and built the temple of
              Apollo at Delphi<note place="bottom">Hom. Hymn to Pyth. Apoll. 118.</note>, and a
              treasury for king Hyrieus. In the wall of this last they placed a stone in such a
              manner that it could be taken out, and by this means from time to time purloined the
              treasure. This amazed Hyrieus ; for his locks and seals were untouched, and yet his
              wealth continually diminished. At length he set a trap for the thief, and Agamedes was
              caught. Trophonios, unable to extricate him, and fearing that when found he would be
              compelled by torture to discover his accomplice, cut off his head<note place="bottom"
                >The same trick is also said to have been played on Augeas, king of Elis, by
                Trophonios the <hi rend="i">step-son</hi> of Agamedes the Arcadian architect (Charax
                  <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch. Aristoph. Clouds, 509.). It also formed an episode of
                the Telegonia. The reader will observe the similarity between this legend and that
                related by Herodotus (ii. 121.) of the Egyptian king Rhampsinitus. Buttmann and
                Müller think the supposition of the story being taken from Herodotus, and told of
                persons and places in Greece, too absurd to deserve refutation. But these ingenious
                writers should have known that no practice is more common, and that abundant
                instances of it are to be found in all times and countries. (See ‘Tales and Popular
                Fictions,’ <hi rend="i">passim.</hi>) We are, however, disposed to regard this as
                one of the tales which the Egyptians (who, by the way, seem never to have been an
                inventive people,) borrowed from the Greeks.</note>. Trophonios himself is said to
              have been shortly afterwards swallowed up by the earth<note place="bottom">Paus. <hi

              temple of Delphi they asked a reward of the god. He promised to give it on the seventh
              day, desiring them meanwhile to live cheerful and happy. On the seventh night they
              died in their sleep.</p>
            <p>There was a celebrated oracle of Trophonios at Lebadeia in Bœotia. During a great
              drought the Bœotians were, it was said, directed by the god at Delphi to seek aid of
              Trophonios in Lebadeia. They came thither, but could find no oracle : one of them
              however happening to see a swarm of bees, they followed them to a chasm in the earth,
              which proved to be the place sought<note place="bottom">Paus. ix. 40. He also relates

            <p>Electryôn, the son of Perseus king of Mycenæ, had given his daughter Alcmena in
              marriage to his nephew Amphitryôn. Having had the misfortune to kill his
              father-in-law, Amphitryôn was forced to fly from Mycenæ. Alcmena and her brother
              Licymnios accompanied his flight, and he was kindly received at Thebes by Creôn, who
              purified him from the guilt of bloodshed.</p>
            <p>While Amphitryôn was absent on an expedition against the Teleboans, Zeus, who had
              become enamoured of Alcmena, assumed the form of her husband, and was admitted by her
              without suspicion to all his privileges. He related to her all the events of the war,
              and by his power extended the night to three times its usual duration. Amphitryôn on
              his return was surprised at the indifference with which he was received by his wife ;
              but on coming to an explanation with her, and consulting Teiresias, he learned that it
              was no less a personage than Zeus himself who had assumed his form<note place="bottom"

            <p>Alcmena brought forth twins, Heracles the son of Zeus, the elder by one night, and
              Iphicles, the progeny of her mortal lord. The children were but eight months old, when
              Hera sent two huge serpents into the chamber to destroy them. Alcmena in terror called
              to her husband to save them, but <pb n="351" xml:id="p351"/>Heracles raised himself up
              on his feet, caught the two mon- sters by the throat and strangled them<note

            <p>When come to a proper age Heracles was instructed in the management of a chariot by
              Amphitryôn himself ; he was taught wrestling by Autolycos, archery by Eurytos, the use
              of arms by Castôr, to play on the lyre by Linos the brother of Orpheus, whose services
              were however but ill rewarded by the young hero, as he killed him with a blow of the
              lyre for having struck him. He was called to account for this deed, and justified
              himself by citing a law of Rhadamanthys, which said that “whœver defends himself
              against any one who makes an unjust assault on him is guiltless,” and he was
                acquitted<note place="bottom">The law according to Aristotle (Eth. v. 8.) was Εἲ к’

            <p>Amphitryôn however, to prevent the recurrence of such an event, sent him away to
              where his herds were feeding, and there he grew up to great strength and size. His
              look was terrible, for he was the son of Zeus ; his stature was four cubits ; fire
              flashed from his eyes : his arrow and his dart never missed. In his eighteenth year,
              while he was still with his father's herds, he slew a huge lion which lay in Mount
              Cithærôn, whence he used to attack the herds of Amphitryôn and of Thestios king of the
              Thespians. Heracles when going to engage the lion was hospitably entertained by
              Thestios for fifty days. Each night one of the fifty daughters of his host ascended
              the couch of the hero, for Thestios was desirous to propagate the race of the son of
              Zeus. But Heracles, unaware of this design, fancied that but one of the maidens had
              enjoyed his embraces<note place="bottom">Apollod. Some said seven, others one night.

              made the skin of his head serve him as a helmet<note place="bottom">Homer arms

            <p>As he was returning from this hunt, he met the heralds sent by Erginos to receive
              tribute from the Thebans. The <pb n="352" xml:id="p352"/>cause of the payment of this
              tribute was as follows : the charioteer of Menœcios had wounded Clymenos, king of the
              Minyans, with a stone in Onchestos the sacred field of Poseidôn. Clymenos, being
              brought in a dying state to Orchomenos, charged his son Erginos to avenge his death.
              Erginos in consequence led an army against the Thebans, and having slain a number of
              them concluded peace on condition of their paying him for twenty years an annual
              tribute of a hundred oxen. It was for this tribute that the heralds were going to
              Thebes when they were met by Heracles, who cutting off their ears and noses, and tying
              their hands to their necks with cords, bade them take that tribute to Erginos and the
              Minyans. Incensed at this insult offered to his heralds, Erginos made war anew on
              Thebes ; but Heracles, having been furnished with arms by Athena, and being appointed
              by the Thebans their general, slew Erginos and routed the Minyans, on whom he imposed
              a tribute the double of what the Thebans used to pay. In this battle Amphitryôn fell
              valiantly fighting. Creôn gave his daughter Megara in marriage to Heracles, and her
              younger sister to Iphicles<note place="bottom">Od. xi. 269.</note>. Alcmena the mother
              of the hero also married Rhadamanthys the son of Zeus, who was then living in Ocaleia
              of Bœotia<note place="bottom">According to Pherecydes (<hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Ant.
                Lib. 33.), when Alcmena, who long survived her son, died, and the Heracleids were
                about to bury her at Thebes, Zeus directed Hermes to steal her away and convey her
                to the Isles of the Blest, where she should espouse Rhadamanthys. Hermes obeyed, and
                placed a stone instead of her in the coffin. When the Heracleids went to carry her
                forth to be buried, they were surprised at the weight, and opening the coffin found
                the stone, which they took out, and set it up in the grove where her <hi rend="i"
                  >Heroön</hi> stood at Thebes.</note>. Heracles was presented with a sword by
              Hermes, a bow by Apollo, a golden breastplate by Hephæstos, horses by Poseidôn, a robe
              by Athena. He himself cut his club in the Nemean wood<note place="bottom">Apollod. <hi

            <p>Some time after his war with the Minyans he fell into madness, owing to the envy of
              Hera, and flung his own three children by Megara, and the two of his brother Iphicles,
              into the fire. As a punishment for this deed he went into voluntary exile, and was
              purified by Thestios. He then went to Delphi, and inquired of the god where he should
              settle. The <pb n="353" xml:id="p353"/>Pythia then first named him Heracles<note

              he had been called Alceides from his grandfather, and she desired him to settle at
              Tiryns, and serve Eurystheus twelve years, and perform twelve tasks to be imposed by
              him. She added that when these tasks were all accomplished, he would be made immortal.
              The hero obeyed, went to Tiryns, and there served Eurystheus.</p>
            <p>The cause of Eurystheus’ obtaining this power was as follows : The day on which
              Alcmena was to be delivered in Thebes, Zeus, in exultation, announced to the gods that
              a man of his race was that day to see the light, who would rule over all his
              neighbours. Hera, pretending incredulity, exacted from him an oath that what he had
              said should be accomplished. Zeus, unsuspicious of guile, swore, and Hera hastened
              down to Argos, where the wife of Sthenelos the son of Perseus was seven months gone of
              a son. The goddess brought on a premature labour, and Eurystheus came to light that
              day, while she checked the parturition of Alcmena, and kept back the Eileithyiæ. The
              oath of Zeus was not to be recalled, and his son was fated to serve Eurystheus<note
                place="bottom">Hom. II. xix. 198.</note>.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">first</hi> task imposed by Eurystheus was to bring him the skin of
              the Nemean lion. This animal was the progeny of Typhôn<note place="bottom">Hesiod
                (Th. 327.) says of Orthos.</note> and Echidna, and invulnerable. On his way to
              engage him Heracles arrived at Cleonæ, where he was hospitably entertained by a
              labouring man named Molorchos. His host being desirous to offer a sacrifice, Heracles
              begged of him to reserve it till the thirtieth day, saying that if he should then
              return victorious he might offer it to Zeus the Saviour ; but if he fell in the
              conflict, to make it a funeral offering to himself as a hero. When he came to the
              Nemean wood and had discovered the lion, he began to ply him with his arrows, but
              finding soon that he was invulnerable, he grasped his club and pursued him to his den,
              which was pervious. He then built up one of the entrances, and going in at the other,
              and grasping the lion’s throat in his hands, held him till he <pb n="354"
                xml:id="p354"/>was suffocated<note place="bottom">See the description of the combat
                in Theocr. Idyll. xxv.</note>. Then taking him on his shoulders, he proceeded toward
              Mycenæ, and coming on the last day of the appointed period to Molorchos’ abode, he
              found him just on the point of offering the victim for him as being dead. Having
              offered the sacrifice to Zeus the Saviour, he brought the lion to Mycenæ. But when
              Eurystheus saw this proof of the wonderful strength of Heracles, he prohibited his
              entrance in future into the city, and ordered him to announce the performance of his
              tasks before the gates. Some even say that the terror of Eurystheus was so great, that
              he had a brazen jar made, in which he used to hide himself underground, and employ the
              herald Copreus, the son of Pelops, to set him his tasks<note place="bottom">II. xv.
                639.</note>. This Copreus, having slain Iphitos, had fled to Mycenæ, and abode there
              with Eurystheus who had purified him.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">second</hi> task was to destroy the Lernæan hydra or water-snake,
              another progeny of Typhôn and Echidna<note place="bottom">Hes. Th. 313.</note>, which
              abode in the marsh of Lerna, whence she used to come out on the land, and kill the
              cattle and ravage the country. This hydra had a huge body with nine heads, eight of
              them mortal, and one in the middle immortal. Heracles mounted his chariot, which was
              driven by Iolaos, the son of Iphicles ; and on coming to Lerna, he stopped the horses
              and went in quest of the hydra, which he found on a rising ground near the springs of
              Amymone, where her hole was. He shot at her with fiery darts till he made her come
              out ; and he then grasped and held her, while she twined herself about his legs. The
              hero crushed her heads with his club, but to no purpose, for when one was crushed two
              sprang up in its stead. A huge crab also aided the hydra, and bit the feet of
              Heracles. He killed the crab, and then he called upon Iolaos to come to his
              assistance. Iolaos immediately set fire to the neighbouring wood, and with the flaming
              brands searing the necks of the hydra as the heads were cut off, effectually checked
              their growth<note place="bottom">The hydra was a sophist, says Socrates, with his
                usual irony (Plat. Euthyd. 297.).</note>. Having thus got rid of the mortal heads,
              Heracles cut off the <pb n="355" xml:id="p355"/>immortal one and buried it ; setting a
              heavy stone on the top of it, in the road leading from Lerna to Eleos. He cut the body
              of the hydra up into pieces, and dipped his arrows in her gall. Eurystheus however
              denied that this was to be reckoned among the twelve tasks, since he had not destroyed
              the hydra alone, but with the assistance of Iolaos.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">third</hi> task was to fetch the horned hind alive to Mycenæ. This
              hind haunted Œnœ, had golden horns, and was sacred to Artemis. Heracles, not wishing
              to kill or wound her, pursued her for an entire year<note place="bottom">Pindar (Ol.
                iii. 55.) makes the hind lead the hero a chase to the country of the
                Hyperboreans.</note>. When the animal was tired with the chase, she took refuge in
              Mount Artemision, then fled to the river Ladôn, and, as she was about to cross that
              stream, Heracles struck her with an arrow, caught her, put her on his shoulder, and
              was going with his burden through Arcadia, when he met Artemis and her brother Apollo.
              The goddess took the hind from him, and reproached him for violating her sacred
              animal. But the hero excusing himself on the plea of necessity, and laying the blame
              on Eurystheus, Artemis was mollified, and allowed him to take the hind alive to
              Mycenæ.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">fourth</hi> task imposed by Eurystheus was to bring him the
              Erymanthian boar also alive. This animal frequented Mount Erymanthos, and thence laid
              waste the region of Psophis. Heracles took his road through Pholoe, where he was
              hospitably entertained by Pholos the Centaur, the son of Silenos and the nymph Melia.
              The Centaur set before his guest roast meat, though he himself fared on it raw.
              Heracles asking for wine, his host said he feared to open the jar, which was the
              common property of the Centaurs ; but when pressed by the hero he consented to unclose
              it for him. The fragrance of the wine spread over the mountain<note place="bottom"
                >Theocr. vii. 149.</note>, and soon brought all the Centaurs armed with stones and
              pine-sticks to the cave of Pholos. The first who ventured to enter were driven back by
              Heracles with burning brands : he hunted the remainder with his arrows to Malea. They
              fled there to Cheirôn, who having been expelled from Pelion by the Lapiths was <pb
                n="356" xml:id="p356"/>dwelling at that place. As Heracles was here shooting at the
              Centaurs, one of his arrows went through the arm of Elatos and stuck in the knee of
              Cheirôn. Grieved at this unhappy event, Heracles ran up, drew out the arrow, and
              applied to the wound a remedy given by Cheirôn himself ; but in vain, the venom of the
              hydra was not to be overcome. Cheirôn retired into his cave, longing to die, but
              unable on account of his immortality, till, on his expressing his willingness to die
              for Prometheus, he was released by death from his misery. The other Centaurs fled to
              different places ; some remained at Malea ; Eurytiôn went to Pholoe, Nessos to the
              river Euenos ; Poseidôn took the rest and sheltered them in Mount Eleusis. When
              Heracles returned to Pholœ, he found Pholos lying dead along with several others ;
              for, having drawn the arrow out of the body of one of them, while he was wondering how
              so small a thing could destroy such large beings, it dropped out of his hand and stuck
              in his foot, and he died immediately<note place="bottom">The proper scene of the
                adventure with the Centaurs must have been Thessaly, as in Euripides, Her. Fur. 365.
                  <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. Heracles buried him, and then set out to hunt the
              boar, and driving him from his lair with loud cries, chased him into a snow-drift,
              where he caught and bound him, and then took him to Mycenæ.</p>
            <p>To clear out in one day all the dung in the stables of Augeas king of Elis, the son
              of Poseidôn (or according to others of the Sun), was the <hi rend="i">fifth</hi> task
              imposed by the relentless Eurystheus<note place="bottom">Theocr. Idyll. xxv.</note>.
              When Heracles came to Augeas, he said nothing to him of the commands of Eurystheus,
              but offered for a tenth of his herds to clean out his stables in one day. Augeas
              agreed, not thinking the thing possible ; and Heracles took Phyleus, the son of
              Augeas, to witness the agreement. He then broke down a part of the wall of the court,
              and turning in the rivers Peneios and Alpheios by a canal, let them run out at the
              other side. Augeas, on learning that this was one of the tasks imposed by Eurystheus,
              not only refused to stand to his agreement, but denied that he had promised anything,
              and offered to lay the matter before judges. When the cause was tried, Phyleus
              honestly gave testimony against his father ; <pb n="357" xml:id="p357"/>and Augeas in
              a rage, even before the votes had been given, ordered both his son and Heracles to
              depart out of Elis. The former retired to Dulichion : the latter went to Dexamenos at
              Olenos, whom he found on the point of being compelled to give his daughter in marriage
              to the Centaur Eurytiôn. Dexamenos imploring his aid, he killed the Centaur as he was
              coming for his bride. Eurystheus however refused to count this also among the twelve
              tasks, saying that he had done it for hire.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">sixth</hi> task was to drive away the Stymphalid birds. These were
              water-fowl, which, afraid of the wolves, fled to lake Stymphalis, which lay embosomed
              in wood near the Arcadian town Stymphalos. While Heracles was deliberating how he
              should scare them, Athena brought him from Hephæstos brazen clappers. He stood under a
              neighbouring hill, and rattled them : the birds terrified rose in the air, and he then
              shot them with his arrows<note place="bottom">Pherecydes, <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch.

            <p>His <hi rend="i">seventh</hi> task was to fetch the Cretan bull. This animal had been
              sent up by Poseidôn when Minôs had vowed to sacrifice whatever should appear from the
              sea. Struck with the beauty and size of the animal, Minôs substituted another, and put
              him among his herds. Poseidôn in anger made the bull run wild and furious. When
              Heracles arrived, Minôs gave him permission to take him if he could. The hero
              succeeded, and brought and showed him to Eurystheus. He then let him go : and the bull
              roved over Sparta and Arcadia, and crossing the Isthmus came to Marathôn in Attica,
              where he did great mischief to the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>For his <hi rend="i">eighth</hi> task he was enjoined to bring to Mycenæ the mares of
              Diomedes of Thrace. This was a son of Ares and Cyrene, and king of the Bistonians. His
              mares were androphagous. Heracles sailed thither with some volunteers, and having
              overcome the grooms, led the mares to the sea. The Bistonians pursued with arms.
              Heracles, leaving the mares in charge of Abderos, his favourite, the son of Hermes, a
              Locrian of Opûs, went to engage them. Meantime the mares tore their keeper to pieces ;
              and the hero, having defeated the Bistonians and slain Diomedes, built a city by the
                <pb n="358" xml:id="p358"/>tomb of Abderos, and named it after him. He brought the
              mares to Eurystheus, who turned them loose ; and they strayed on to Mount Olympos,
              where they were destroyed by the wild beasts.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">ninth</hi> task was to bring to his master the girdle of Hippolyta
              queen of the Amazons<note place="bottom">See Appendix (K.).</note>, who dwelt about
              the river Thermodôn. This nation was composed of women, who were renowned for their
              valour. When they bore children, they reared the females alone. They cut off their
              right breasts, that they might not impede them in drawing the bow. Hippolyta was
              mistress of the belt of Ares, as a token of her exceeding all the Amazons in valour.
              This girdle Eurystheus coveted for his daughter Admeta, and he ordered Heracles to
              bring it to him.</p>
            <p>Having drawn together some volunteers, among whom were Theseus and Castôr and
              Polydeukes, he sailed to the isle of Paros, where four sons of Minôs dwelt. Two of the
              ship's company happening to be slain by them, Heracles killed several of the Parians,
              and besieged the rest, till they offered to give him any two he wished in the place of
              the companions he had lost. He chose Alcæos and Sthenelos, the sons of Androgeos, and
              then sailed on to Mysia, where he was hospitably entertained by Lycos, king of the
              Mariandynians, whom he aided against the Bebrycians, and slew their king Mygdôn, the
              brother of Amycos. He took a large portion of their territory and gave it to Lycos,
              who named it Heracleia. The hero reached at length the haven of Themiscyra, where
              Hippolyta came to inquire the cause of his arrival, and on hearing it she promised to
              give him her girdle. But Hera, taking the form of an Amazon, went and persuaded the
              rest that the strangers were carrying off their queen. They instantly armed, mounted
              their horses, and came down to the ship. Heracles, thinking that Hippolyta had acted
              treacherously, slew her, and taking her girdle made sail homewards.</p>
            <p>He stopped at Troy, then in great distress from the wrath of Poseidôn and Apollo.
              These gods had contracted with Laomedôn, king of Troy, to build a wall round the
              town ; but when the wall was completed, Laomedôn refused to pay <pb n="359"
                xml:id="p359"/>the wages agreed on, and dismissed them, threatening to cut off their
              ears. He even menaced to tie Apollo hand and foot and transport him to the distant
                islands<note place="bottom">II. xxi. 441 ; see above, p. 123. The poet (Il. xx.

                of the taking of Troy by Heracles, on account of the horses, relating to which
                Laomedôn had broken his word.</note>. To punish him Apollo sent a pestilence, and
              Poseidôn a flood bearing a huge sea-monster, who carried off all the people to be
              found in the plain. The oracle being consulted declared that there would be no end of
              the evil till Laomedôn had given his daughter Hesione<note place="bottom">Hesione is
                the same as Eïone (name of a Nereïs, Hes. Th. 255.) and comes from ἠ<hi rend="i"

              exposed her, fastened to a rock which overhung the sea. Heracles, having seen the
              maiden, offered to deliver her if Laomedôn would give him the mares which Zeus had
              presented to Trôs, in exchange for his son Ganymedes. Laomedôn assented, and Heracles
              slew the monster and delivered Hesione : but the faithless Trojan refused to keep his
              word, and the hero sailed away, threatening to return and make war on Troy.</p>

              him, but was slain by his arrows ; and Heracles, placing the oxen in the cup, brought
              them over to the continent, where he returned his vessel to the Sun-god. He drove his
              cattle through Iberia, and came to Lygia, where Alebiôn and Dercinos, the sons of

                pelted and overcame his enemies. This was when he was on his way to the Hesperides

              country, swam over to Sicily, and came to the lands of Eryx the son of Poseidôn, who
              ruled over the Elymians. Eryx put the bull among his herds ; and Heracles, committing
              the care of his other cattle to Hephæstos, went in quest of the stray one. When he
              found him, he required Eryx to give him up ; but he refused, unless he would wrestle
              with him. Heracles accepted the challenge, and flinging him three times to the ground
              killed him. He then drove his cattle along the Ionian Sea. At the ‘recess of the sea’
              (i. e. the head of the gulf) Hera set the oxen mad, and they ran raging through <pb

              overtaken a part of them at the Hellespont, he drove them toward the Peloponnese,

            <p>On his way in quest of the apples Heracles came to the river Echedoros, where he was
              challenged to a single combat by Cycnos the son of Ares and Pyrene. Ares defended his
              son ; and Zeus ended the conflict by casting a thunderbolt between the combatants.
              Heracles passed on through Illyria, thence to the Eridanos, and came to the nymphs,
              the daughters of Zeus and Themis. These directed him to Nereus, whom he found asleep ;
              and, in spite of his numerous changes of form, bound and held him fast, and never let
              him go till he had told him where the golden apples were. Having gotten this
              information, he went on to Tartessos, and crossing over to Libya went on till he came
              to Irassa by lake Tritonis<note place="bottom">Sch. Pind. Pyth. ix. 183. See Milton,

              kill all strangers by forcing them to wrestle with him, and to hang their skulls on

              him to the ground he rose with renewed strength, he held him in his arms till he died.
              Antæos, on account of this property, was said to be the son of Earth<note

            <p>From Libya he went to Egypt, where Busiris, another son of Poseidôn, reigned. This
              king, in consequence of an oracle, offered up strangers on the altar of Zeus : for
              Egypt having <pb n="362" xml:id="p362"/>been afflicted with a dearth for nine years, a
              Cyprian named Phrasios, a great soothsayer, came thither, and said that it would cease
              if they sacrificed a stranger every year to Zeus. Busiris sacrificed the prophet
              himself first, and then continued the practice. Heracles on his arrival was seized and
              dragged to the altar ; but he burst his bonds, and slew Busiris, his son Amphidamas,
              and his herald Chalbes<note place="bottom">The conjecture of Müller (<hi rend="i">ut

              Prometheus lay chained, and, moved by his entreaties, shot the eagle that preyed on

              apples, but to send Atlas for them, and in the mean time to support the heaven in his
              stead. The hero did as desired, and Atlas at his request went and obtained three
              apples from the Hesperides ; but he said he would take them himself to Eurystheus, and
              that Heracles might continue to support the heavens. At the suggestion of Prometheus
              the hero feigned consent, but begged him to hold the heaven till he had made a pad to
              put on his head. Atlas threw down the apples, and resumed his burden ; and Heracles

              could not be admitted, as he had not been purified of the blood of the Centaurs.
              Eumolpos however purified him, and he then saw the mysteries, after which he proceeded

              rock by the offended monarch of Erebos. When they saw Heracles they stretched forth
              their hands, hoping to be relieved by his might. He took Theseus by the hand, and
              raised him up<note place="bottom">For an effect of this on the bodily conformation of

              same for Peirithoös, the earth quaked, and he left him. He then rolled off Ascalaphos,
              the son of Acherôn and Gorgyra, the rock which Demeter had cast on his body. Wishing
              to give the shades blood to drink, he took one of the oxen of Hades, and killed it.
              Menœtios, the son of Keuthonymos the herdsman, immediately challenged him to wrestle.
              Heracles laid hold on him, broke his ribs, and but for the prayers of Persephone would
              have killed him on the spot. He then asked Pluto to give him Cerberos ; and the god
              consented, provided he could take him without using his weapons. He found him at the
              gate of Acherôn ; and, protected only by his corslet and lion’s skin, he flung his
              arms about his head, and grasping him by the neck made him submit, though the dragon
              in his tail bit him severely. He brought him through Trœzên to Eurystheus ; and when

              was for giving his sister to Heracles ; but Eurytos and his other sons refused, lest
              he should destroy her children, if she had any, as he had done those of Megara.
              Shortly afterwards the oxen of Eurytos being stolen by Autolycos, his suspicions fell
              upon Heracles. Iphitos, who gave no credit to this charge, betook himself to that
              hero, and besought him to join in search of the lost oxen. Heracles promised to do so,
              and entertained him ; but falling again into madness, he precipitated Iphitos from the
              walls of Tiryns. In order to be purified of this murder he went to Neleus, who being a
              friend of Eurytos refused to comply with his desire. Heracles then went to Amyclæ,
              where he was purified by Deïphobos the son of Hippolytos. But he fell notwithstanding
              into a severe malady on account of the murder of Iphitos ; and going to Delphi to seek
              relief, he was refused a response by the Pythia. In his rage at her denial he went to

              combatants, and put an end to their contest. Heracles now received a response, that
              his malady would be removed if he let himself be sold for three years as a slave, and

              it is said,) was offered to Eurytos, but he refused to accept it.</p>
            <p>When the term of his servitude was expired, he prepared, being now relieved of his
              disease, to take his long-threatened vengeance on Laomedôn. He accordingly collected a
              fleet of eighteen<note place="bottom">Homer (II. v. 641.) says <hi rend="i">six</hi>
                ships.</note> fifty-oared vessels, manned by a valiant band of volunteer warriors,
              and sailed for Ilion. Leaving the fleet under the charge of Oïcles, he led his men
              against the town ; but while he was advancing toward it, Laomedôn fell on the ships,
              and Oïcles was slain in the attack ; Laomedôn was however driven back and besieged in
              the town. Telamôn succeeded in making a breach in the walls, and entered. Heracles
              followed with his drawn sword, for he would have no one thought his superior. When
              Telamôn saw this he began to collect the stones which were lying near him ; and on
              Heracles asking him what he was doing, said that he was raising an altar to Heracles
              Callinicos (<hi rend="i">Victor</hi>). Heracles slew with his arrows Laomedôn and all
              his sons but Podarkes. He gave Hesione to Telamôn as a reward of his valour, and
              allowed her to choose one among the captives to be set at liberty. When she had fixed
              on her brother Podarkes, Heracles replied that he must first be made a slave, and then
              she might give something for him and redeem him. She took her golden veil off her
              head, and with it bought him ; and hence he was afterwards named Priamos (<hi rend="i"
                >Purchased</hi>) instead of Podarkes (<hi rend="i">Swift-foot</hi>).</p>
            <p>As Heracles was sailing homewards from Troy, he was assailed by a furious storm, sent
              by Hera<note place="bottom">Il. xv. 18.</note>, which drove him to the isle of Côs.
              The inhabitants taking the strangers for pirates assailed them with stones, and
              endeavoured to prevent their landing ; but they were defeated, and their king
              Eurypylos, the son of Poseidôn and Astypalæa, was slain. Heracles was himself wounded
              in the fight by Chalcodôn. Having <pb n="366" xml:id="p366"/>ravaged Côs, he went at
              the call of Athena to Phlegra, where he fought with the Gods against the Giants.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards he collected an army of Arcadians and volunteers from most of the
              towns of Greece, and marched against Augeas ; who put his Eleians under the command of
              his nephews Eurytos and Cteatos, the sons of Molione and Actôr, who excelled all men
              of that time in strength<note place="bottom">See below, chap. x. <hi rend="i"
                  >Eurytos</hi> and <hi rend="i">Cteatos.</hi></note>. Heracles happening to fall
              sick, made a truce with the Molionids ; but when they heard of his illness, they
              attacked his army, and killed several of his men. He retired at that time ; but in the
              third Isthmiad afterwards, when the Eleians sent the Molionids to Cleonæ to offer
              sacrifice, he waylaid and killed them. He then led an army into Elis, took the city,
              slew Augeas and his sons, and set Phyleus on the throne. He also established the
              Olympic games, raised an altar to Pelops, and built altars to the twelve gods in
              order.</p>
            <p>After the capture of Elis he marched against Pylos, took the city, and killed Neleus
              and all his sons, except Nestôr, who was living with the Gereneans<note place="bottom"
                >Il. xi. 689. See below, chap. x. <hi rend="i">Neleus.</hi></note>. He is also said

                    alludes perhaps to this event.</p></quote></note>. He then marched to Lacedæmôn,
              to punish the sons of Hippocoön for having slain Œonos the son of Licymnios. For as
              this youth was gazing on the palace of Hippocoön, the house-dog flew at him : he flung
              a stone at the dog ; which so enraged the sons of Hippocoön, that they rushed out with
              sticks and beat him to death<note place="bottom">Paus. iii. 15, 4.</note>. Heracles
              therefore, to avenge his death, collected an army. At Tegea in Arcadia he asked
              Cepheus, who had twenty sons, to join in the expedition : but Cepheus, afraid lest
              during his absence the Argives might make an attempt on Tegea, declined the proposal.
              Heracles, who had in a water-urn a brazen ringlet of the Gorgôn, which Athena had
              given him, presented it to Aërope the daughter of Cepheus, and told her, that if when
              a hostile army should <pb n="367" xml:id="p367"/>approach she would show it three
              times from the walls without looking at it herself, they would take to flight. Cepheus
              and his sons now joined Heracles ; but they all fell in battle, and with them Iphicles
              the brother of the hero. Hippocoön himself was slain in the engagement, his sons were
              taken prisoners, and his kingdom was given to Tyndareos.</p>
            <p>Returning through Tegea, Heracles violated, without knowing her, Auge the daughter of
              Aleos. She secretly brought forth a son, whom she laid in the sacred inclosure (<hi
                rend="i">τέμϵνος</hi>) of Athena. A famine coming on the land, Aleos went into the
                <hi rend="i">temenos</hi> of the goddess ; and searching about, found his daughter's
              infant, which he exposed on Mount Parthenion. But the babe was protected by the care
              of the gods ; for a hind, which had just calved, came and suckled him ; and the
              shepherds finding him named him Telephos from that circumstance<note place="bottom"
                  ><hi rend="i">Τήλϵϕοѕ</hi>, from <hi rend="i">ἔλαϕοs a hind.</hi> Its true

                the worship of Athena Alea (above, p. 158.). See Paus. viii. 47. Welcker, Kret.
                Kol. 12.</note>. Aleos gave his daughter Auge to Nauplios the son of Poseidôn, to
              sell her out of the country ; and he disposed of her to Teuthras king of Teuthrania on
              the Caÿster in Mysia, who made her his wife. Telephos having, when grown up, consulted
              the oracle respecting his parents, came to Mysia, where he was kindly received by
              Teuthras, whom he succeeded in his kingdom.</p>
            <p>Heracles went afterwards to Calydôn, where he sought the hand of Deïaneira the
              daughter of Œneus<note place="bottom">When he met Meleagros in Erebos the latter
                besought him to marry his sister. (Sch. Il. xxi. 194.)</note>. He had to contend for
              her with the river-god Acheloös, who turned himself into a bull ; in which form one of
              his horns was broken off by the victorious hero. The vanquished river-god gave him in
              exchange for it the horn of Amaltheia<note place="bottom">Amaltheia (above, p. 79.)
                was the goat that suckled the infant Zeus ; the name is probably derived from <hi
                  rend="i">ἀμαλὸς, tender</hi>, or from <hi rend="i">ἀμέλγω, to milk.</hi> It was a
                pleasing fiction to make her horn pour forth ambrosia and nectar. According to later
                writers Amaltheia was a nymph, the possessor of the horn, the daughter of Oceanos
                (Sch. Il. xxi. 194.), or Hæmonios (Pher. <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Apollod. ii. 7.5.),
                or Olenos (Theon. ad Arat. 64.).</note>. Heracles afterwards assisted the
              Calydonians against the Thesprotians, and took <pb n="368" xml:id="p368"/>the city of
              Ephyra, over which Phylas reigned, by whose daughter Astyoche he became the father of
              Tlepolemos.</p>
            <p>One day at the table of Œneus, as Eunomos the son of Architeles was, according to
              custom, pouring water on the hands of the guests, Heracles happening unawares to swing
              his hand suddenly struck the boy and killed him<note place="bottom">See Fairy
                Mythology, vol. i. p. 206. <hi rend="i">note</hi>, for a somewhat similar proof of
                the strength of Holger Dansk.</note>. As it was evidently an accident, the father
              forgave the death of his son ; but Heracles resolved to banish himself, agreeably to
              the law in such cases, and he set out with his wife for Trachis, the realm of his
              friend Ceÿx. On their way they came to the river Euenos, where Nessos the Centaur had
              taken his abode, and carried over travellers, saying he had received this office from
              the gods as a reward for his uprightness. Heracles went across through the water
              himself, having agreed on the price for the conveyance of Deïaneira. Nessos attempted
              to offer violence to his fair freight. She resisted, and cried out loudly ; and
              Heracles, hearing her screams, shot Nessos through the heart as he came on shore. The
              dying Centaur thought on revenge : he called Deïaneira to him, and told her if she
              would possess a philtre, or means of securing the love of Heracles, to keep carefully
              the blood which flowed from his wound, — an advice with which she incautiously
              complied.</p>
            <p>As they were going through the country of the Dryopians Heracles became extremely
              hungry, and meeting a man named Theiodamas driving a wain with two oxen, he unyoked
              one of them, and killed, dressed, and ate it. He took with him Hylas the son of
              Theiodamas, who became his especial favourite. While residing with Ceÿx he aided
              Ægimios, king of the Dorians, against whom the Lapiths under the command of Coronos
              had made war, on account of a dispute respecting their boundaries, and had besieged
              him in his town. Heracles slew Coronos, and put Ægimios in possession of the whole
              country that had been in dispute. He afterwards killed Laogoras king of the Dryopians
              and his children, as he was feasting in the sacred ground of Apollo, on account of his
              violence and his aiding the Lapiths.</p>

              witnessed the fate of his son, would avenge him, he received a wound in the thigh from
              the spear of the hero<note place="bottom">Hesiod, Shield of Heracles.</note>.</p>
            <p>Returning to Trachis, Heracles collected an army, and made war on Eurytos king of
              Œchalia (in Eubœa), whom he killed, together with his sons ; and having buried those
              of his own men who had fallen, among whom were Hippasos the son of Ceÿx, and Argeios
              and Melas the sons of Licymnios, he plundered the town and led Iola away captive. At
              the Eubœan promontory Cenæos he raised an altar to Zeus ; and wishing to offer a
              sacrifice, sent to Ceÿx for a splendid robe to wear. Deïaneira hearing about Iola from
              the messenger, and fearing the effect of her charms on the heart of her husband,
              resolved to try the efficacy of the philtre of Nessos, and tinged with it the tunic
              which was sent. Heracles, suspecting nothing, put on the fatal garment and prepared to
              offer sacrifice. At first he felt no effect from it, but when it warmed the venom of
              the hydra began to consume his flesh. In his fury he caught Lichas, the ill-fated
              bearer of the poisoned tunic, by the foot, and hurled him into the sea<note
                place="bottom">From Œta say Ovid (Met. ix. 165. 217.) and Milton (P. L. ii.
                545.).</note>. He attempted to tear off the tunic, but it adhered closely to his
              skin, and the flesh came away with it. In this wretched state he got on shipboard and
              returned to Trachis ; where Deïaneira, on learning the consequence of what she had
              done, hanged herself ; and Heracles, charging Hyllos his eldest son by her to marry
              Iola when he was of sufficient age, had himself carried to the summit of Mount Œta,
              and there causing a pyre to be constructed, ascended it, and directed his followers to
              set it on fire<note place="bottom">See Sophocles’ Trachiniæ.</note>. But no one would
              venture to obey ; till Pœas, happening to arrive there in search of his stray cattle,
              complied with the desire of the hero, and received his bow and arrows as his reward.
              While the pyre was flaming, a thunder-cloud conveyed the sufferer to heaven, where he
              was endowed with immortality ; <pb n="370" xml:id="p370"/>and being reconciled to Hera
              he espoused her daughter Hebe, by whom he had two children named Alexiares (<hi

            <p>Before we enter on the consideration of the mythology of Heracles, we will give the
              beautiful and ingenious, but, as appears to us, fanciful view of it taken by a modern
                critic<note place="bottom">Buttmann, Mytholog. i. 246. <hi rend="i"
              >seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>This mythe is, according to him, one of extreme antiquity and great beauty, setting
              forth the ideal of human perfection, consecrated to the weal of mankind, or rather in
              its original form to that of the hero's own nation. This perfection, according to the
              ideas of the heroic age, consists in the greatest bodily strength united with the
              advantages of mind and soul recognised by that age. Such a hero is, therefore, a man :
              but these noble qualities in him are of divine origin ; and he is made to be the son
              of the king of the gods, by a mortal mother. To render his perfection the more
              manifest, the poet gives him a twin-brother, the child of a mortal sire. As virtue is
              not to be learned, Heracles exhibits his strength and courage in infancy ; he
              strangles the snakes, which fill his brother with terror. The character of the hero
              throughout life, as that of the avenger of injustice and punisher of evil, must
              exhibit itself in the boy as the wild instinct of nature ; and the mythe makes him
              kill his tutor Linos with a blow of the lyre. When sent away by Amphitryôn, he
              prepares himself, in the stillness and solitude of the shepherd’s life, by feats of
              strength and courage, for his future task of purifying the earth of violence.</p>
            <p>The beautiful tale of Prodicus, on the choice of Heracles between virtue and
              effeminacy, is a component part of the original mythe, to which it suits so
              accurately. For if the virtue of Heracles was to be of any value, it must be the
              result of choice, and he must be tempted and resist the temptation. It was also
              necessary for the perfection of virtue that it should encounter continued opposition ;
              and Grecian mythology, which contained no being of pure and unmixed evil, but gods of
              mingled character like men, furnished in the jealous Hera a deity to oppose and
              afflict the son of Zeus. But if <pb n="371" xml:id="p371"/>the object of the
              persecution of one power, he must be — in conformity to all analogy — under the
              protection of another ; and Pallas-Athene, the goddess of wisdom and mental energy,
              appears throughout the ancient form of the mythe as the constant guardian of the
              hero.</p>
            <p>The number of tasks may not have been originally twelve, though most accounts agree
              in that number ; but they were all of a nature agreeable to the ideas of an heroic
              age, — the destruction of monsters, and bringing home to his own country the valuable
              productions of other regions<note place="bottom">As Homer does not seem to have known
                anything of the Hyperboreans, the task of going for the apples of the Hesperides is
                probably a fiction as late as the time of Hesiod, or even later.</note>. These
              labours are chiefly allegorical. The Hydra, for instance, was meant to represent the
              evils of democratic anarchy, with its numerous heads, against which though one may not
              be able to effect anything, yet the union of even two may suffice to overcome it.</p>
            <p>The toils of the hero conclude with the greatest and most rare of all in the heroic
              age, — the conquest over death. This is represented by his descent into the
              under-world, and dragging Cerberos to light, as a proof of his victory. In the old
              mythe he was made to engage with and wound Aïdes ; and the Alcestis of Euripides
              exhibits him in conflict with Death.</p>
            <p>But virtue, to be a useful example, must occasionally succumb to human weakness and
              the power of the evil principle. Hence Heracles falls into fits of madness, sent on
              him by Hera ; and hence, like the Rinaldo and Ruggiero of romance, he becomes the
              willing slave of Omphale, the fair queen of Lydia, and changes his club and lion’s
              skin for the distaff and the female robe. The mythe at length concludes most nobly
              with the assumption of the hero into Olympos. His protecting deity abandons him to the
              power of his persevering enemy<note place="bottom">᾽Аλλά ἐ Μοῑῤ ἐδἀμασσϵ καὶ ἀργαλέος

                >αὐτὸѕ</hi>) was on Olympos. Two diametrically opposed species of

              the realms of Hades, while the divine portion, <hi rend="i">himself</hi> (<hi rend="i"
                >αὐτὸς</hi>), ascends from the pyre in a thunder-cloud, and the object of Hera's
              persecution being now effected, espouses Youth the daughter of his reconciled foe.</p>
            <p>Our chief objection to this beautiful theory is its making the mythe of Heracles,
              from the very commencement, one entire and consistent fiction, framed with a moral
              view. This we regard as contrary to the mythic analogy, which, though it might devise
              single mythes, like that of Ixiôn, in order to illustrate some ethic principle, never
              conducted the heroes through a long series of adventures like those of Heracles.</p>
            <p>The mythology of this hero is of a very mixed character in the form in which it has
              come down to us. There is in it the identification of one or more Grecian heroes with
              Melcart, a god of the Phœnicians, and perhaps with one of the deities of Egypt. Hence
              we find Heracles so frequently represented as the sun-god, and his twelve labours
              regarded as the passage of the sun through the twelve signs of the zodiac.</p>
            <p>The Grecian adventures of Heracles are placed in Thessaly (chiefly about Mount Œta),
              Ætolia and the Peloponnese ; and as the Dorians, whose princes were supposed to be
              descended from Heracles, had relations with all these countries, Müller<note
                place="bottom">Dorians, book ii. chap. 11. 12.</note> views in him the national hero
              of the Dorian race. He regards as the original exploits of the Dorian Heracles the
              conquest of Œchalia, the marriage with Deïaneira (that is, the league between the
              Dorians and Ætolians for the invasion of the Peloponnese), the taking of Ephyra, with
              which he connects the wounding of Hades, and the whole of the Heraclean Necyia, and
              even the carrying away of the cattle of Geryoneus, whom with Hecatæus he places in
              Epeiros, and finally the death on the summit of Œta. He thinks that the Peloponnesian
              adventures were mostly invented after the time of the Dorian invasion, which they were
              intended to justify ; there may, he allows, have been an Argive hero of perhaps the
              same name, who was the destroyer of the Nemean lion ; but the enmity of Hera, the
              delay at his birth, the servitude to Eurystheus, etc., are Dorian legends, and <pb
                n="373" xml:id="p373"/>meant to represent the political and religious contests
              between the ancient inhabitants and the invaders. The mythology of Heracles at Thebes
              was, he thinks, introduced from Delphi, or by the Doric Heracleids. That he did not
              belong to the Cadmeian mythology, is proved by the legend of the coming of Alcmena to
              Thebes, and by the fact of his temples there being without the walls, — a fact which
              is quite conclusive, as the ancient deities of a city always had their temples on or
              near the citadel. Returning to the Peloponnese ; the adventures there, he says, may be
              divided into two classes, the combats with men and those with beasts. Of the former
              are the conquest of Pylos, Laconia and Elis, and the establishment of the Olympic
              games, in all of which there is a historic reference. The latter are perhaps of a
              symbolical nature. Many of the adventures out of Greece are to be referred to the
              Greek colonists of the places which are made the scene of them.</p>
            <p>We have thus given a sketch of the theory of this most able mythologist, and there is
              much in it to which it is difficult to refuse assent. But we think that, like his
              theory of Apollo, it is too much affected by what appear to us his exaggerated idea of
              the influence of Doric ideas and institutions in Greece. There are, in fact, parts of
              the Heraclean mythology to our apprehension almost inexplicable on this hypothesis :
              his name too, <hi rend="i">Hera-renowned</hi>, seems quite unsuitable to a hero of the
              Dorians anterior to the Migration. This however may be obviated by supposing the name
              of the Dorian hero to have been different, and that of the Argive to have been adopted
              in its stead. But again, it does not seem likely that an Argive hero should be the
              object of persecution to the Argive goddess ; on the contrary, all analogy would lead
              us to suppose him, from his name, to have been her favourite<note place="bottom">All
                the compounds of this form seem to be in a good sense. Such are Sophocles,
                Agathocles, Callicles, Hierocles, Themistocles, Eucles. Diocles, Hermocles,
                Theocles, seem to intimate the divine favour.</note>. We would therefore hint as a
              possibility, that the original Heracles was the conception of a Peloponnesian
                hero<note place="bottom">Heracles, son of the <hi rend="i">Strong-one</hi> (Alcmena)
                by Zeus-Amphitryôn (<hi rend="i">Wearer-out</hi> or <hi rend="i"
                >Vanquisher</hi>).</note>, who, in obedience to the great goddess of the country
              (the goddess of the <pb n="374" xml:id="p374"/>earth), cleared it of the noxious
              animals that infested it, and, it may be, went on toilsome journeys to distant regions
              to bring home cattle and plants to adorn and improve it ; but that when he was
              identified with the Doric hero a new series of adventures was devised for him, and he
              was made the object of the persecution instead of the favour of the Argive goddess. We
              do not think that the identification with Melcart had much influence beyond that of
              localising some of the legends, such as that of Geryoneus.</p>
            <p>In the Homeric poems there is, as we have seen, frequent mention of Heracles ; and in
              the Theogony his birth at Thebes, his combats with the Nemean lion, the hydra and
              Geryoneus, his release of Prometheus and marriage with Hebe, are noticed. In the Eoiæ
              the conquest of Pylos and other events were recorded ; the Shield relates the combat
              with Cycnos ; and the Ægimios and Wedding of Ceÿx, ascribed to Hesiod, contained
              adventures of this hero. Of the age of these poems however we can only make a
              conjecture ; for it is well known that some of the Hesiodic poems, as they are called,
              come down even below the thirtieth Olympiad. Cinæthos of Lacedæmôn, who flourished
              about the fifth Olympiad, composed a Heracleia, and Peisander of Cameiros (about
              Ol. 33.) another very celebrated one ; Stesichorus of Himera (Ol. 48.) also composed a
              lyric poem named the Geryoneïs, on the expedition to Erytheia ; Panyasis of Samos (Ol.
              72.) wrote a Heracleia in fourteen books, containing nearly as many verses as the
              Odyssey.</p>
            <p>Pherecydes, Hellanicus and Hecatæus all gave the adventures of Heracles a place in
              their works ; and Herodorus of Heracleia on the Pontus, a contemporary of Socrates,
              composed a long Heracleia in prose. The Attic tragedians also introduced Heracles into
              their dramas ; and as they viewed him as a Bœotian, his character was treated with but
              little ceremony on some occasions. Apollodorus and Diodorus relate the adventures of
              this hero ; they were also the subjects of the verses of the Alexandrian and the Latin
              poets.</p>

            <p rend="noindent"><hi rend="sc">Ogyges</hi>, in whose time the Bœotic flood is placed,
              is said by some to have been the first who reigned over Attica and Bœotia : his son
              Eleusinos was the founder of Eleusis.</p>
            <p>But in general Cecrops is held to have been the first who ruled over the country
              called Cecropia from him, and Attica from its peninsular form. He is said by
              mythologists to have been an autochthôn, i. e. one who came from no foreign country,
              but was born in, and as it were from, the land ; and, like autochthones in general, to
              have had a body composed of those of a man and a snake. In his time the gods began to
              choose cities for themselves ; and Poseidôn and Athena both fixed on Athens. The
              former came and struck the middle of the future Acropolis with his trident, and formed
              the well of salt water in the Erichtheion ; Athena then came, and making Cecrops
              witness of her taking possession, planted the olive which stood in the Pandrosion.
              Twelve gods sat to decide the cause ; and on the testimony of Cecrops, they adjudged
              the place to Athena. She named the city from herself, and Poseidôn testified his anger
              by laying the Thriasian plain under water<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 14. For
                other marks of the vengeance of this god, see Sch. Aristoph. Eccles. 473. Varro, Fr.

            <p>Cecrops married Agraulos the daughter of Actæos, who bore him a son Erysichthôn, and
              three daughters, Agraulos, Herse, and Pandrosos. Erysichthôn died without children ;
              Agraulos had by Ares a daughter named Alcippe<note place="bottom">Above,
                p. 107.</note>, and Herse by Hermes a son named Cephalos<note place="bottom">Above,
                p. 164.</note>.</p>
            <p>One of the earliest events recorded in modern histories of Greece is the coming of
              Cecrops, at the head of a colony, from <pb n="376" xml:id="p376"/>Saïs in Lower Egypt
              to Attica, where he civilised the rude aborigines, gave them religion, marriage, and
              other social institutions, and taught them to cultivate corn for their subsistence.
              This remarkable event is placed, on the authority of the Parian Chronicle, <hi
                rend="sc">b</hi>. <num>c</num>. 1582.</p>
            <p>It may therefore seem strange that Cecrops should apparently have been utterly
              unknown to Homer and Hesiod ; that the cyclic and the lyric poets do not speak of
              him ; that the logographers, and their follower Apollodorus, seem ignorant of his
              Egyptian birth ; that the same should be the case with the dramatists ; and that
              Herodotus should speak of the Athena of Saïs and of the Attic Cecrops without giving
              the slightest hint of any connexion between them. Plato is, in fact, the first who
              intimates it ; the priests of Saïs, he says, informed Solôn out of their
              temple-archives that the goddess Neïth or Athena was the founder of both their cities,
              but that Athens was the elder by one thousand years. When in those remote ages the
              people of the isle Atlantis invaded the countries within the Pillars of Heracles, the
              Athenians bravely repelled them ; and in the war Cecrops, Erechtheus, Erichthonios and
              Erysichthôn distinguished themselves<note place="bottom">Timæus, 21. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi> Critias, 108. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>We should think it hardly necessary to inform the reader that the whole story of the
              Atlantis, and everything relating to it, is as pure a fiction as the Utopia or any
              other political romance, and that Plato makes in it the same use of Solôn that he does
              of Socrates on other occasions. At all events he gives not the slightest hint of
              Cecrops being an Egyptian, but rather the very reverse. Elsewhere he states the
              genuine Athenian creed of his day. “Neither a Pelops nor a Danaos, nor a Cadmos, nor
              an Ægyptos, nor any other, who, being originally a Barbarian, has been naturalised
              among the Hellenes, has settled among us. We are of pure Hellenic blood, no mixed
              people, and thence the hatred of foreign manners and customs is especially implanted
              in our city<note place="bottom">Menexenus, 245. Isocrates (Enc. Hel. 20. Panath. 19.)
                omits Cecrops in his list of Athenian kings ; and he speaks (Panath. 258.) of the
                Athenian autochthony in the same manner as Plato. See also Euripides Fr. Erechtheus,
                i. 7. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.”</p>
            <p>The first notice of the Egyptian origin of the Athenians <pb n="377" xml:id="p377"
              />appeared in a work which went under the name of Theopompus, but which was a forgery
              intended to injure him. It was named Τ<hi rend="i">ρικάρανος</hi>, and it attacked the
              traditions and history of Athens, Sparta, and Thebes. On the other hand Callistratus
              and Phanodemus maintained that Saïs was colonised from Athens. In the time of the
              Ptolemies it became the fashion to regard the Egyptians as the colonisers of half the
              world. Still it is only in an imperfect fragment of Diodorus and in Scholia that the
              Egyptian Cecrops occurs. Few then, we think, will now dissent from the following
              judgement : “The derivation of Cecrops from Saïs is a historic <hi rend="i"
                >sophism</hi> and no mythe<note place="bottom">See Müller, Orchom. 106. <hi rend="i"

              >seq.</hi></note>.”</p>
            <p>Cecrops then is purely an ideal being, and the names of his family all relate to
              agriculture and to the worship of the tutelar deity of Athens. Thus he is married to
                <hi rend="i">Field-dwelling</hi> (Agraulos), the daughter of the land (Actæos). He
              has one son, <hi rend="i">Mildew</hi> (Erysichthon), who dies childless and before
              himself ; and three daughters, <hi rend="i">Field-dwelling</hi> (Agraulos), <hi
                rend="i">All-dew</hi> (Pandrosos) and <hi rend="i">Dew</hi> (Herse). The first bears
              a daughter, <hi rend="i">Strongmare</hi> (Alcippe), to the god of war ; the third a
              son, <hi rend="i">Shady</hi> (Cephalos), to the rural deity Hermes. There were temples
              of both Agraulos and Pandrosos at Athens ; and, as Athena herself was called by these
                names<note place="bottom">Sch. Aristoph. Lys. 439. Harpocrat. <hi rend="i">v.</hi>
                  Ἅ<hi rend="i">γραυλοѕ</hi>.</note>, they were probably only personifications of
              her epithets. As Herse and Pandrosos are the same in signification, it is probable
              that, like the Athenian Graces and Seasons, the Cecropides were only two
                originally<note place="bottom">The Erechtheides Protogeneia and Pandora formed
                another pair.</note>.</p>
            <p>There only remains to be explained the name Cecrops or Cercops ; and when we
              recollect that the ancient Athenians wore golden <hi rend="i">tettiges</hi> or

              some arms, the artist was filled by Aphrodite with desire, and attempted to offer
              violence to the maiden-goddess. She fled ; he pursued, and though lame overtook her,
              but was unable to overcome her resistance. The legend proceeds to relate the birth of
              Erichthonios after a manner which gives no very high idea of Athenian delicacy<note
                place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 14, 5. 6.</note>. The goddess resolved to bestow
              immortality on the babe. She laid him therefore in a coffer, which she gave in charge
              to Pandrosos the daughter of Cecrops, with an injunction not to open it. Pandrosos was
              obedient ; but the curiosity of her sisters made them unclose the coffer, in which
              they beheld the babe, who terminated in a snake. As a punishment Athena struck them
              with madness, and they precipitated themselves from the Acropolis. Erichthonios was
              reared by Athena in her <hi rend="i">temenos</hi> ; and when he was grown up he
              expelled Amphictyôn, and reigned over Athens. He set up the statue of Athena on the
              Acropolis, and instituted the festival of the Panathenæa. He is said to have been the
              first who used the four-horsed chariot. He had by the Naïs Pasithea a son named
              Pandiôn, who succeeded him. Erichthonios when he died was buried in the <hi rend="i"

              might be discovered, he cut out her tongue and confined her : she contrived however to
              communicate her story to her sister by means of characters woven into a peplos. Procne
              then sought out and released her sister ; and killing her own son Itys, served his

              sleep, the swallow of one half of hers, in consequence of that unhallowed meal in
              Thrace. The legend is one of those invented to account mythically for the habits and
              properties of animals. The twitter of the swallow sounds like <hi rend="i">Itys,

            <p>On the death of Pandiôn his sons Erechtheus and Butes divided his offices between

            <p>Erechtheus married Praxithea, a grand-daughter of the Cephissos, and had by her five

            <p>Procris, the eldest daughter of Erechtheus, was married to Cephalos the son of Deïôn
              the son of Æolos. They dwelt at Thoricos in Attica, and were happy, till curiosity to
              try the fidelity of his wife entered the mind of Cephalos. Feigning a journey of eight
              years he disguised himself, and came to Procris with a splendid jewel, which he
              offered to her as the price of her favours. After much hesitation her virtue yielded ;
              her husband then discovered himself and reproached her. She fled from him in shame,
              but soon after they were reconciled. Cephalos went constantly to the chase ; and
              Procris, suspicious, as she had failed herself, fancied that he was <pb n="382"
                xml:id="p382"/>attracted by the charms of some other fair-one. She questioned the
              slave who used to accompany him ; and he told her that his master frequently ascended
              the summit of a hill, and cried “Come, Nephela, come !” Procris went to the designated
              hill, and concealed herself in a thicket ; and on Cephalos’ crying “Come, Nephela,
              come !” she rushed forwards to her husband, who in his astonishment and confusion
              threw his dart and killed her<note place="bottom">Pherecydes, <hi rend="i">ap.</hi>
                Sch. Od. xi. 321.</note>.</p>
            <p>This legend also is told with great variations. It was said that Cephalos refused to
              comply with the wishes of Eôs, pleading his fidelity to his wife, and that the goddess
              changed his form to put the faith of Procris to the test. Procris on finding how she
              had been deceived fled to Crete, where Minôs gave her an inevitable dart, and a dog
              named Lælaps (<hi rend="i">Whirlwind</hi>), which no beast could escape. She then cut
              her hair short, and attiring herself as a man came to Thoricos and challenged Cephalos
              to a match at hunting. He was easily overcome, and seeing the wonderful virtues of the
              dog and dart he sought to obtain them. The terms were those he had himself proposed to
              Procris. He yielded ; Procris then discovered herself and reproached him, but they
              were soon reconciled and she gave him the dog and dart. The story then concludes as

            <p>According to another account the virtue of Procris had not been proof against the
              offer of a golden coronet from Pteliôn. Her infidelity being discovered by her
              husband, she fled to Minôs king of Crete, whom she enabled to have children, and

              could overtake, and joined Amphitryôn in the chase of it : his dog Lælaps ran it

              was grown up, the husband of Benthesicyme gave him one of his two daughters in

              Tegyrios, was once more forced to fly, and he came to Eleusis. Ismaros dying, Tegyrios

              it was also said, took advantage of the same night. Ægeus when departing charged Æthra
              if she bore a son to rear him, and to tell no one whose he was. He moreover placed his
              sword and shoes under a large stone, and directed her to send his son to him when he
              was able to roll away the stone and take them from under it.</p>
            <p>Ægeus returned to Athens ; and when Medeia came thither from Corinth, he married her.
              He also celebrated Panathenæan games ; in which Androgeôs the son of Minos overcame
              all his opponents. Ægeus, envious of his worth, engaged him to go and fight with the
              Marathonian bull, and the valiant youth fell in the attempt. According to other
              accounts, Ægeus laid an ambush for him as he was going to Thebes, where games were to
              be celebrated by Laïos.</p>
            <p>Minôs made war on Athens to avenge the death of his son. Megara fell as above
              related. Athens held out ; but being closely pressed with hunger, the Athenians,
              according to an ancient oracle, sacrificed on the grave of the Cyclôps Geræstos the
              four daughters of Hyacinthos, who had settled there. This bloody deed was of no
              avail ; and the oracle declared, that the naming of the satisfaction he required must
              be left to Minôs himself. He demanded seven youths and seven maids to be sent every
              ninth year to be devoured by the Minotaur. This hard condition was for some time
              complied with. At length Theseus, the son of the king, voluntarily proposed to attempt
              their deliverance. He went, and succeeded ; but he forgot to change his black sails to
              white, as agreed on in case of success ; and Ægeus, thinking that his son was lost,
              cast himself from the Acropolis and perished<note place="bottom">Plut. Thes. 22.

            <p>The son of Ægeus by Æthra was named Theseus. When grown to the proper age, his mother
              led him to the stone under which his father had deposited his sword and shoes, and he
              removed it with ease and took them out. He was now to proceed to Athens and present
              himself to his father. As the roads were infested by robbers, his grandfather Pittheus
              pressed him earnestly to take the shorter and safer way over the Saronic gulf ; but
              the youth, feeling in himself the spirit and the soul of a hero, resolved to signalise
              himself like Heracles, with whose fame all Greece now rang, by destroying the
              evil-doers and the monsters that oppressed the country ; and he determined on the more
              perilous and adventurous journey by land.</p>
            <p>His first day's journey brought him to Epidauros, where dwelt a man named Periphates,
              a son of Hephæstos. This ferocious savage always went armed with an iron club, whence
              he was called <hi rend="i">Club-bearer</hi> (Κ<hi rend="i">ορυνήτης</hi>) ; and all
              travellers stood in terror of his cruelty. When he saw Theseus approach, he
              immediately assailed him ; but he speedily fell beneath the blows of the young hero,
              who took possession of his club, and bore it ever afterwards as a memorial of his
              first victory<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 16. 1. Plut. Thes. 8. Diodor. iv.

            <p>Theseus now pursued his journey, and met with no interruption till he came to the
              Isthmus of Corinth. Here he found another ‘faitour,’ who, from the great mischief
              which he did to all the surrounding country, was called by no other name than that of
                Sinis<note place="bottom">From <hi rend="i">σίνω, to injure.</hi></note>, i. e. <hi
                rend="i">Evil-doer.</hi> His strength was so great, that he was able to take by
              their tops the pine-trees with which the Isthmus was at that time overgrown, and bend
              them to the ground ; and hence he was called <hi rend="i">Pine-bender</hi> (Π<hi
                rend="i">ιτυοκάμπτης</hi>). He posted himself on the road, and obliged all
              passengers to take hold of a pine with him and bend it, and when it was bent he would
              let it go, and the tree flying up the unhappy stranger was dashed to the ground and
              killed. Theseus, on being challenged, though he had never before attempted such a
              feat, held down the tree with ease ; and then, <pb n="388" xml:id="p388"/>to punish
              Sinis for his previous cruelty, killed him, and hung him out of one of the pines<note

            <p>Before he left the neighbourhood of the Isthmus, Theseus delivered the people of
              Cromyon, a village near Corinth, from a huge sow which ravaged their lands. He hunted
              and killed this monster<note place="bottom">Plut. Thes. 9. Strabo, viii. 6. Pans. ii.

            <p>As he approached the borders of Megara, he came to the narrow path overhanging the
              sea, where the robber Scirôn — from whom the pass derived its name — had fixed his
              abode. The practice of Scirôn was, when any stranger came to him, to invert the duties
              of hospitality ; and instead of giving water to wash the feet of his guest, to insist
              on the guest’s washing the feet of the host. This ceremony was performed on the pass ;
              and while the guest was engaged in the operation, Scirôn would give him a kick, which
              tumbled him down into the sea, where a huge tortoise always lay ready to devour the
              bodies of those who were thrown down. Theseus killed Scirôn himself, and flung his
              body down to the tortoise<note place="bottom">Plut. Diodor. and Hygin. <hi rend="i">ut

            <p>Theseus came now to Eleusis, where Cercyôn, said to be a son of Hephæstos, reigned.
              Like many of those whom Heracles encountered, Cercyôn forced all comers to wrestle
              with him, and killed the vanquished. Theseus accepting his challenge overcame him, and
              paid him in his own coin<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id. ib.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Not far from thence, on the banks of the Cephissos, Theseus met with Damastes, named
              the <hi rend="i">Beater-out</hi> or <hi rend="i">Stretcher</hi> (Π<hi rend="i"
                >ροκρούστης</hi>), and the <hi rend="i">Hurtful</hi> (Π<hi rend="i">ο</hi>λ<hi
                rend="i">υπήμων</hi>). This Damastes had two iron bedsteads, one long, the other
              short. When a stranger came, he took him, if short of stature, to the long bedstead,
              and stretched and pulled him, as he said, to make him fit it, till the life left him.
              But if the stranger should be tall, he assigned him the short bedstead, and then cut
              as much off him as made him of the same length as his bed. But Theseus meted to him
              with his own measure<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id. ib.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Having overcome all the perils of the road, Theseus at length reached Athens, where
              new danger awaited him. He <pb n="389" xml:id="p389"/>found his father's court all in
              confusion. The Pallantids, or sons and grandsons of Pallas the brother of Ægeus, had
              long seen with jealousy the sceptre in the hands of an old man, and meditated wresting
              it from his feeble grasp. Thinking however that his death could not be very remote,
              they resolved to wait for that event, but they made no secret of their intentions. The
              arrival of Theseus threatened to disconcert their plan. They feared that if this young
              stranger should be received as a son by the old king, he might find in him a protector
              and avenger ; and they resolved to poison his mind against him. Their plot so far
              succeeded, that Ægeus was on the point of sacrificing his son, when he recognised him,
              and then acknowledged him in the presence of all the people. The Pallantids had
              recourse to arms, but Theseus defeated and slew them<note place="bottom"
                >Plut. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>Medeia, it is also said, who was married to Ægeus, fearing the loss of her influence
              when Theseus should have been acknowledged by his father, resolved to anticipate that
              event ; and moved by her calumnies, Ægeus was presenting a cup of poison to his son,
              when the sight of the sword left with Æthra discovered to him who he was<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> 12.</note>.</p>
            <p>The bull which Heracles had brought from Crete was now at Marathôn, and the country
              was in terror of his ravages. Theseus, probably deeming this a good opportunity of
              recommending himself to the people over whom he was likely to reign, resolved to
              deliver them from the ferocious animal. He went in quest of him, overcame and
              exhibited him in chains to the astonished eyes of the Athenians, who did not know
              which was the greater, their admiration of the victory or their terror of the combat.
              Theseus then sacrificed the bull to Apollo Delphinios<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i"

            <p>The Athenians were at this period in deep affliction, on account of the tribute which
              they were forced to pay to Minôs king of Crete. Theseus resolved to deliver them from
              this calamity, or to die in the attempt. Accordingly when the third time of sending
              off the tribute came, and the youths and maidens were according to custom drawn by lot
              to be sent, in spite of the entreaties of his father to the contrary, he <pb n="390"
                xml:id="p390"/>voluntarily offered himself as one of the victims. The ship departed
              as usual under black sails, which Theseus promised his father to change for white in
              case of his returning victorious. When they arrived in Crete, the youths and maidens
              were exhibited before Minôs ; and Ariadne the daughter of the king, who was present,
              became deeply enamoured of Theseus, by whom her love was speedily returned. She
              furnished him with a clue of thread, which enabled him to penetrate in safety the
              windings of the labyrinth, till he came to where the Minotaur lay, whom he caught by
              the hair and slew. He then got on board with his companions, and sailed for Athens.
              Ariadne accompanied his flight, but was abandoned by him on the isle of Dia or
                Naxos<note place="bottom">Plut. 15 — 19. See below, chap. xii. <hi rend="i"
                  >Ariadne.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Before he returned to Athens, Theseus sailed to Delos to pay his vow : for ere
              setting out on his perilous expedition, he had made a vow to send annually, if
              successful, to the temple of the god, a ship with gifts and sacrifices<note
                place="bottom">Plut. 21. The practice of sending a ship annually to Delos — whatever
                may have given occasion to it — long continued. While it was absent no sentence of
                death could be executed in Athens ; because, as it was said, it commemorated the
                deliverance of the youths and maidens. The ship sent, called the Paralian Galley,
                was maintained to be the very same one in which Theseus had sailed ; though it had
                been so often repaired, as to give occasion to a celebrated question among the
                sophists respecting its identity. Plut. Thes. 23.</note>. He also consecrated in
              that island to Aphrodite a statue made by Dædalos, on account of the aid she had given
              him. He moreover, to commemorate his victory, established there a dance, the
              evolutions of which imitated the windings of the labyrinth<note place="bottom">This is
                evidently founded on the lines of Homer, Il. xviii. 590. <hi rend="i"

            <p>On approaching the coast of Attica Theseus forgot the signal appointed by his father,
              and returned under the same sails with which he had departed ; and the old king,
              thinking he was bereaved of his newly-found son, ended his life. Theseus, with the
              general approbation, mounted the vacant throne.</p>
            <p>The hero now turned his thoughts to legislation. The Attic territory had been divided
              by Cecrops into twelve Demes or villages, each of which had its own government and
              chief magistrate, and was almost wholly independent. The <pb n="391" xml:id="p391"
              />consequence was, frequent and sanguinary wars among them. Nothing but pressing
              external danger forced them to union, which was again dissolved as soon as the storm
              was over.</p>
            <p>Theseus therefore invited not merely the people of Attica, but even strangers and
              foreigners, to settle at Athens, then nothing but a castle on a rock. By his prudence
              and his authority he induced the heads of the villages to resign their independent
              sovereignty, and entrust the administration of justice to a court, which should sit
              constantly at Athens, and exercise jurisdiction over all the inhabitants of Attica. He
              abolished the former division of the people of Attica into four tribes, and
              substituted that of a distribution into three classes, of the Nobles, the
              Agriculturists, and the Manufacturers. The nobles were put in possession of all
              offices and dignities ; but the choice of the persons from the body of the nobles to
              fill them was left to the people.</p>
            <p>The result of these judicious regulations was the increase of the town of Athens, and
              of the population in general ; the establishment of just liberty, and at the same time
              the augmentation of the royal power, and the reduction of that of the nobles,
              heretofore the source of such continual broils and dissensions. As a further means of
              uniting the people, Theseus established numerous festivals, particularly the
              Panathenæa, solemnized with great splendour every fifth year, in commemoration of this
              union of the inhabitants of Attica.</p>
            <p>Theseus firmly established the boundaries of the Attic territory, in which he
              included Megaris, and set up a pillar on the Isthmus of Corinth to mark the limits of
              Attica and the Peloponnese. Near this pillar he renewed the Isthmian games, in
              imitation of the Olympic lately established by Heracles.</p>
            <p>These civic cares did not prevent Theseus from taking part in military enterprises :
              he accompanied Heracles in his expedition against the Amazons, who dwelt on the banks
              of the Thermodôn ; and distinguished himself so much in the conflict, that Heracles
              after the victory bestowed on him, as the reward of his valour, the hand of the
              vanquished queen Antiope. When the Amazons afterwards in revenge invaded the Attic
              territory, they met with a signal defeat from the Athenian prince.</p>
            <pb n="392" xml:id="p392"/><p>Theseus was also a sharer in the dangers of the Calydonian
              hunt ; he was one of the adventurous band who sailed in the Argo to Colchis ; and he
              aided his friend Peirithoös and the Lapiths in their conflict with the Centaurs. The
              friendship between him and Peirithoös was of a most intimate nature ; yet it had
              originated in the midst of arms. Peirithoös had one time made an irruption into the
              plain of Marathon, and carried off the herds of the king of Athens. Theseus, on
              receiving information, went to repel the plunderers. The moment Peirithoös beheld him,
              he was seized with secret admiration ; he stretched out his hand as a token of peace,
              and cried, “Be judge thyself ! What satisfaction dost thou require ?” — “Thy
              friendship,” replied the Athenian ; and they swore inviolable fidelity.</p>
            <p>Like faithful comrades, they aided each other in every project. Each was ambitious in
              love, and would possess a daughter of the king of the gods. Theseus fixed his thoughts
              on Helena the daughter of Leda, then a child of but nine years. The friends planned
              the carrying her off, and they succeeded. Placing her under the care of his mother
              Æthra at Aphidnæ, Theseus prepared to assist his friend in a bolder and more perilous
              attempt : for Peirithoös, after the death of Hippodameia, resolved to venture on the
              daring deed of carrying away from the palace of the monarch of the underworld his
              queen Persephone. Theseus, though aware of the risk, would not abandon his friend.
              They descended together to the region of shadows ; but Aïdes, knowing their design,
              seized them, and placed them on an enchanted rock at the gate of his realms ; where
              they sat unable to move, till Heracles passing by in his descent for Cerberos free'd
              Theseus, but was by a divine intimation prevented from aiding his friend, who remained
              there everlastingly in punishment of his audacious attempt<note place="bottom">Those
                who would assign a historical foundation to the wild and fanciful fictions of
                ancient poets, tell us that Persephone was wife to Aïdoneus king of the Molossians ;
                that his dog was called Cerberos, who tore Peirithoös to pieces, etc. We have
                already expressed our dissent from this tasteless mode of procedure.</note>.</p>
            <p>After the death of Antiope, who had borne him a son named Hippolytos, Theseus married
              Phædra the daughter of Minôs and sister of Ariadne. This princess was seized with a
                <pb n="393" xml:id="p393"/>violent affection for the son of the Amazôn, — an
              affection produced by the wrath of Aphrodite against Hippolytos for neglecting her
              deity, and devoting himself solely to the service of Artemis, or against Phædra as the
              daughter of Pasiphae. During the absence of Theseus the queen made advances of love to
              her step-son, which were indignantly repelled by the virtuous youth. Filled with fear
              and hate, on the return of her husband she accused to him his innocent son of an
              attempt on her honour. Without giving the youth an opportunity of clearing himself,
              the blinded prince, calling to mind that Poseidôn had promised him the accomplishment
              of whatever wish he should first form, cursed and implored destruction on his son from
              the god. As Hippolytos, leaving Trœzên, was driving his chariot along the sea-shore, a
              monster sent by Poseidôn from the deep terrified his horses ; they burst away in fury,
              heedless of their driver, dashed the chariot to pieces, and dragged along Hippolytos
              entangled in the reins, till life abandoned him. Phædra ended her days by her own
              hand ; and Theseus, when too late, learned the innocence of his son<note
                place="bottom">The circumstance of women accusing those who have refused their
                favours is common to the history and the fable of most countries. The earliest
                instance on record is that of Joseph and Potiphar's wife ; and, under the names of
                Yoosuf and Zooleikha, their adventure is the theme of romance over the Mohammedan
                East. The stories of Peleus, Bellerophontes, Hippolytos and Muenos (Plut. de
                Fluv. 8.), occur as we may perceive in Grecian mythology, and those of Sir Lanval
                (Fairy Mythology, i. p. 54.) and of Tristan and Belinda (Tristan de Leonnois) are to
                be found in the romance of the middle ages. The case most similar to the present
                occurs in the Persian Shâh-Nâmeh, where Siyawush the son of Ky Kaoos, king of
                Persia, is, on rejecting the amorous advances of his step-mother Soodâbeh, accused
                by her to his father ; but the gallant youth clears himself by going through the
                ordeal of fire, riding in golden helm and snowy raiment between the flaming piles,
                kindled by two hundred men. Another case is that of the sons of Camarez-Zemân, in
                the Thousand and One Nights.</note>.</p>
            <p>The invasion of Attica by Castôr and Polydeukes, to avenge the carrying off of their
              sister, and an insurrection of the Pallantids, brought on Theseus the usual fate of
              all great Athenians, — exile. He voluntarily retired to Lycomedes, king of the island
              of Scyros, and there he met with his death, either by accident or by the treachery of
              his host : for ascending with Lycomedes a lofty rock, to take a view of the island, he
              fell or was pushed off by his companion, and lost his life by <pb n="394"
                xml:id="p394"/>the fall. The Athenians honoured his memory by feasts and temples,
              placed him among the gods, and called their city the town of Theseus.</p>
            <p>We will now pursue the explanation of the legendary history of Attica from the time
              of Cecrops.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary for us, we presume, to set about proving that king <hi rend="i"
                >Rocky</hi> or <hi rend="i">Hilly</hi> (Cranaos), his wife <hi rend="i">Plain</hi>
              (Pedias) and his daughter <hi rend="i">Attica</hi> (Atthis) are not historical
              personages. It is equally needless to show that Amphictyôn, or rather
              Amphictiôn, — the personification of the people who dwelt about (<hi rend="i"
                >ἀμϕικτίονες</hi>) Thermopylæ, and were united for a common political and religious
              object, — could not have been a real person, much less a king of Attica. We will
              therefore commence with Erichthonios or Erechtheus, whom the more ancient tradition
              viewed as the first Attic king.</p>
            <p>We have seen how entirely Cecrops and his family belong to the worship of
              Pallas-Athene. Beside this goddess, the symbol of the mild celestial heat, the ancient
              people of Attica adored Hephæstos, the terrestrial fire or heat which was the origin
              of metallurgy ; Hermes the deity who wrought within the earth, giving increase to
              fruits and cattle ; and Poseidôn, the great nourishing principle of water. These are
              the only deities whom we find noticed in the early Attic mythes.</p>
            <p>Erechtheus and Erichthonios are the same person, and are nothing more than the name
              by which Poseidôn was worshiped on the Acropolis. It is well known that none but the
              ancient deities of the nation ever had temples or altars on the citadel ; but we find
              a part of the temple of Athena-Polias named the Erechtheion, and sacred to Erechtheus,
              and in it there were altars of Hephæstos, Butes and Poseidôn, on which last sacrifices
              were made to Erechtheus<note place="bottom">Paus. i. 26, 5.</note>. In this temple
              also was the well of salt water which Poseidôn was said to have produced with his
              trident ; it was called the ‘Erechthean Sea<note place="bottom">θάλασσu ̓ Ε<hi

              the same, <pb n="395" xml:id="p395"/>appears from this, that Homer and Hesiod tell of
              the latter what others relate of the former. In fact Erechtheus is only the

              find this deity, when made a hero, assigned the origins above related. It is probable
              that in the more ancient legend there was a <hi rend="i">Holy Marriage</hi> (<hi
                rend="i">ἱερὸς γάμος</hi>) of Hephæstos and Athena, the celestial and terrestrial
              heat, of which the offspring was a serpent-formed son, that is, the tender twining
              plant which proceeds from the seed, and of which the care was committed to the sisters
                <hi rend="i">Dew</hi> and <hi rend="i">Field-dwelling.</hi> The other circumstances
              of the legend may be referred to the imagination of those who took on them to
              embellish and extend it, and to the freaks of etymology in which the ancients found
              such pleasure in indulging. The ascribing to Erichthonios the invention of the
              four-horse chariot, is a confirmation of his identity with Poseidôn ; and it may be
              observed, that his Trojan namesake was renowned for his stud<note place="bottom">Il.
                xx. 221.</note>.</p>
            <p>It may be that Pandiôn is indebted for his Attic royalty to his part in the mythe of
              the nightingale and swallow, which was perhaps only appropriated by the Athenians,
              like that of Oreithyia, and possibly that of Cephalos and Procris, though this last
              seems to be a genuine Attic mythe. As for Cecrops II. and Pandiôn II., they are
              manifestly employed merely to establish a connexion between the Erechtheids and
              Theseus ; and Pylos would probably never have been king of Megara, if the Neleids of
              Pylos had not come to Attica at the time of the Dorian Migration.</p>
            <p>We are now to consider Iôn, the personification of the Ionians. The mythe above
              noticed was evidently devised to account for the abode of the Ionians in Attica, where
              their settlement was probably effected by conquest. Whence they came is uncertain ;
              but the name of the Ionian sea would seem to place their original abode on the north
              coast of the <pb n="396" xml:id="p396"/>Peloponnese<note place="bottom">Mr. Kenrick's
                derivation of this name is very plausible ; — ̓Η<hi rend="i">ιονἰα</hi>, ̓Ι<hi

                >sea-coast.</hi></note>. As Iôn is the son of Apollo (for Xuthos is apparently
              nothing more than an epithet of that god<note place="bottom">Ξ<hi rend="i">οȗθοѕ,
                  yellow-haired</hi>, is the same as ξ<hi rend="i">ανθὀѕ</hi></note>), they are to
              be regarded as the introducers of the worship of Apollo into Attica, where it seems to
              have been originally confined to the military class. The name Creüsa (<hi rend="i"
                >Princess</hi>) in this legend, (like that of it and Creôn (<hi rend="i"
              >Prince</hi>) in so many others,) shows that it was a mere fiction, and did not speak
              of real persons.</p>
            <p>Lycos, Pallas and Nisos, the sons of Pandiôn, have as little claim to reality as any
              of the others. As the Lyceion at Athens was said to have been named from Lycos, and
              there was on it a temple of Apollo Lycios<note place="bottom">Paus. i. 19, 3.</note>,
              it is not unlikely that the god and the prince were the same person. Pallas may in
              like manner have been connected with the patron-goddess of the city<note
                place="bottom"><p>We are also told of a giant Pallas, from whom the goddess derived

                  <hi rend="i">νησαία</hi>.</note>, and thence probably was derived the name of the
              king Nisos. The story of him and his daughter Scylla is one of the many tales of
              maidens betraying their parents and country for love or lucre. We shall find it
              repeated in Pterilaos and Comætho, and every one has heard of the Roman Tarpeia<note
                place="bottom">The daughter of the governor of the castle of Abydos thus betrayed it
                to the Turks. In the Shâh-Nâmeh, Meliketh (<hi rend="i">Princess</hi>), daughter of
                an Arab chief, delivers him and his castle up to Shâh-pûr, with whom she had fallen
                in love.</note>.</p>
            <p>Ægeus is plainly only another name for Poseidôn, who was also named Ægæos<note
                place="bottom">Pherecydes, <hi rend="i">ap.</hi> Sch. Apoll. Rh. i. 831.</note> and
                Ægæôn<note place="bottom">Callim. Fr. (Bentl.) 103. Lyc. 135. Hesychius and
                Phavorinus <hi rend="i">s. v.</hi> See Appendix (D.).</note>. In fact it was also
              said that Poseidôn was the father of Theseus, who comes from Trœzên (where Poseidôn
              was the guardian-god — <hi rend="i">πολιοȗχος</hi>), and clears the Isthmus (which was
              sacred to that god) of <pb n="397" xml:id="p397"/>monsters and evil-doers. We also
              find that Theseus was worshiped on the eighth day of the month, which was the sacred
              day of Poseidôn<note place="bottom">Plut. Thes. 36. See Müller, Proleg. 271.
                272.</note>. There seems to have been a distinction between the ancient
              Poseidôn-Erechtheus of the agricultural Pelasgic people of Attica and the
              Poseidôn-Ægeus of the Ionians, to whom Theseus evidently belongs, the latter being
              regarded more as the god of the sea and of navigation, corresponding with the more
              active military character of the Ionian race. In proof of Theseus being of this race,
              we may observe that he seems to be rather in opposition with the ancient deities of
              the place. Some of the evil-doers whom he slays are sons of Hephæstos ; and though the
              veneration of the Athenians for their guardian-goddess, and that analogy which did not
              admit of enmity between the ruling deity and the hero of the place, prevented Athena's
              being viewed as hostile to him, we may perceive that he is almost the only hero whom
              she does not assist. In the mythology of Theseus we only meet the Ionian deities
              Poseidôn and Apollo.</p>
            <p>Theseus, whose name signifies the <hi rend="i">Orderer</hi> or <hi rend="i"
                >Regulator</hi>, can only be regarded as an imaginary person. Being the patron-hero
              of the people among whom literature flourished most, he is presented to us under a
              more historic aspect than the other heroes. Though his adventures are manifestly
              formed on those of Heracles, whom he is said to have emulated, we are struck by the
              absence of the marvellous in them. If we except the descent to Erebos, they are hardly
              more wonderful than those of Aristomenes. The poem which recorded them was apparently
              of no great merit, and the history of Theseus yielded few subjects to the Attic
              dramatists. When they brought him on the stage it was hardly ever as the principal
              character of the piece. He always however appears as the model of a just and moderate
              ruler, the example of a strict obedience to the dictates of law and equity, the
              protector of the suppliant, the scourge of the evil-doer, and the author of wise and
              good regulations. In the spirit of casting splendour on actual political relations by
              throwing them back to the mythic ages, the dramatists and orators of Athens did not
              hesitate to make Theseus the founder of the democracy !</p>

            <p>Dædalos was the son of Eupalamos, son of Metiôn, son of Erechtheus : he was
              celebrated for his skill in architecture and statuary, of which latter art he was
              regarded as the inventor. His nephew, named Talôs or Perdix, showed a great genius for
              mechanics ; having, from the contemplation of a serpent’s teeth, invented a saw, and
              applied it to the cutting up of timber. Dædalos, jealous of the skill, and
              apprehensive of the rivalry of the young man, cast him down from the Acropolis and
              killed him. For this murder he was banished by the court of Areiopagos, and he betook
              himself to Minôs king of Crete, for whom he built the Labyrinth. He also devised an
              ingenious species of dance for Ariadne the daughter of that monarch<note
                place="bottom">Il. xviii. 590.</note> ; but having formed the wooden cow for
              Pasiphae, he incurred the displeasure of the king and was thrown into prison. Having
              by means of Pasiphae escaped from confinement, he determined to fly from Crete ; but
              being unable to get away by sea, he resolved to attempt flight through the air. He
              made wings of feathers united by wax for himself and his son Icaros. They mounted into
              the air ; but Icaros ascending too high and approaching too near the sun, its heat
              melted the wax, and the youth fell into the sea and was drowned. Dædalos arrived in
              safety in Sicily, where he was kindly received by Cocalos king of that island, who
              took up arms in his defence against Minôs when he pursued him thither<note

            <p>Dædalos, as his own name (which perhaps was merely an epithet of Hephæstos) and those
              of his progenitors show, was a personification of manual art. He was the Eponymos of
              the class of Dædalids or statuaries at Athens, and there were various wooden statues
              preserved till late times, and said to be the work of his hands. Icaros (from <hi

              suitable name for his son, and the resemblance between it and the name of the Icarian
              sea probably gave occasion to the legend of the flight through the air.</p>

            usually passed through it, the voyage round cape Malea being considered so very
            dangerous. As might be expected, the principal object of worship at Corinth was the god
            of the sea. Poseidôn and Helios, said the legend, once contended for the possession of
            the land ; Briareôs was chosen arbitrator, and he assigned the Isthmus to the former,
            the Acrocorinth or citadel to the latter<note place="bottom">Paus. ii. 1, 6. As Briareôs

            <p>Sisyphos, the son of Æolos, was said to be the founder of Ephyra. He married Merope
              the daughter of Atlas, by whom he had four sons, Glaucos, Ornytiôn, Thersandros and
                Halmos<note place="bottom">Paus. ii. 4, 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>When Zeus carried off Ægina the daughter of Asopos, the river-god in his search after
              her came to Corinth. Sisyphos, on his giving him a spring for the Acrocorinth,
              informed him who the ravisher was. The king of the gods sent Death to punish the
              informer ; but Sisyphos contrived to outwit Death, and even to put fetters on him ;
              and there was great joy among mortals, for no one died. Hades however set Death at
              liberty, and Sisyphos was given up to him. When dying he <pb n="400" xml:id="p400"

              conduct. But when he found himself again in his own house, he refused to leave it.
              Hermes however reduced him to obedience ; and when he came down, Hades set him to roll

            <p>The craft of Sisyphos, of which the following is an instance, was proverbial.
              Autolycos the son of Hermes, the celebrated cattle-stealer, who dwelt on Parnassos,
              used to deface the marks of the cattle, which he carried off in such a manner as to

              Sisyphos, and he defaced the marks as usual ; but when Sisyphos came in quest of them,
              he, to the great surprise of the thief, selected his own beasts out of the herd ; for
              he had marked the initial of his name under their hoofs<note place="bottom">The

              desire of knowledge, which aspires to attain a height it is denied to man to reach,
              and exhausted in the effort falls suddenly back into the depths of earthly weakness.

              Glaucos the grandson of Bellerophontes.</p>
            <p>The gods had endowed Bellerophontes with manly vigour and beauty. Anteia, the wife of
              Prœtos king of Argos, fixed her love upon him, and sought a corresponding return. But
                <pb n="402" xml:id="p402"/>the virtuous youth rejecting all her amorous advances,
              hate occupied the place of love in the bosom of the disappointed queen. She accused
              him to Prœtos of an attempt on her honour. The credulous king gave ear to her
              falsehood, but would not incur the reproach of putting him to death, as she desired.
              He therefore sent Bellerophontes to Lycia, to his father-in-law the king of that
              country, giving him ‘deadly characters’ written in a sealed tablet<note place="bottom"
                >It is a disputed point whether these characters were letters, or of the same kind
                with the Mexican picture-writing. See Wolf's Prolegomena to Homer.</note>, which he
              was to present to the king of Lycia, and which were to cause his death.</p>
            <p>Beneath the potent guidance of the gods Bellerophontes came to Lycia and the flowing
              Xanthos. Nine days the king entertained him, and slew nine oxen ; ‘but when the tenth
              rose-fingered Dawn appeared,’ he asked to see the <hi rend="i">token</hi>
              (σῆμα) which he had brought from his son-in-law. When he had received it, he
              resolved to comply with the desire of Prœtos ; and he first sent his guest to slay the
              Chimæra, a monster with the upper part a lion, the lower a serpent, the middle a goat
                (χ<hi rend="i">ίμαιρα</hi>), and which breathed forth flaming fire. Depending on the
              signs of the gods, Bellerophontes slew this monster, and then was ordered to go and
              fight the Solymians ; and this he said was the severest combat he ever fought. He
              lastly slew the ‘man-like Amazons ;’ and as he was returning the king laid an ambush
              for him, composed of the bravest men of Lycia ; of whom not one returned home, for
              Bellerophontes slew them all. The king now perceiving him to be of the race of the
              gods, kept him in Lycia, giving him his daughter and half the royal dignity, and the
              people bestowed on him an ample <hi rend="i">temenos</hi> of arable and plantation
              land. By this princess Bellerophontes had three children, Isandros, Hippolochos, and
              Laodameia ; which last was by Zeus the mother of Sarpedôn. Falling at length under the
              displeasure of all the gods, ‘he wandered alone in the ‘Plain of Wandering’ (<hi
                rend="i">πεδίον ἀλήϊον</hi>), consuming his soul, shunning the path of men.’</p>

                155. Tzetz. Lyc. 17.</note> that Bellerophontes was at first named Hipponoös : but
              having accidentally killed one of his <pb n="403" xml:id="p403"/>relatives named
              Belleros, he thence derived his second name. He was purified of the bloodshed by
              Prœtos, whose wife is also called Sthenobœa, and the king of Lycia is named Iobates.
              By the aid of the winged steed Pegasos Bellerophontes gained the victory over all whom
              Iobates sent him to encounter. Sthenobœa, hearing of his success, hung herself.
              Bellerophontes at last attempted by means of Pegasos to ascend to heaven : Zeus,
              incensed at his boldness, sent an insect to sting the steed ; and he flung his rider
              to the earth, where he wandered in solitude and melancholy till his death.</p>
            <p>Though Homer makes no mention of Pegasos, this steed forms an essential part of the
              mythe of Bellerophontes. In the Theogony it is said of the Chimæra that she was killed
              by Pegasos and the ‘good (<hi rend="i">ἐσθ</hi>λ<hi rend="i">òς</hi>)
                Bellerophontes’<note place="bottom">Theog. 325. ̛ Ε<hi rend="i">σθ</hi>λ<hi rend="i"
                  >ὸs</hi> and ἀ<hi rend="i">γαθὸs</hi> in the old Greek poets answer exactly to the
                  <hi rend="i">good</hi> of the romances of chivalry, where the <hi rend="i"
                  >good</hi> knight is the <hi rend="i">brave</hi> knight.</note>. But though all
              seem agreed in giving the winged steed to the hero, none tell us how he obtained him.
              Here however Pindar comes to our aid with a very remarkable legend, which connects
              Bellerophontes with Corinth (and it is the only account that really does so), and
              furnishes us with a key to his mythe.</p>
            <p>According to this poet<note place="bottom">Ol. xiii. 85. <hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi></note>, Bellerophontes, who reigned at Corinth, being about to undertake
              the three adventures above mentioned, wished to possess the winged steed Pegasos, who
              used to come to drink at the fount of Peirene on the Acrocorinth. After many fruitless
              efforts to catch him he applied for advice to the soothsayer Polyeidos, and was
              directed by him to go and sleep at the altar of Athena. He obeyed the prophet, and in
              the dead of the night the goddess and raised an altar to herself as Hippeia
              ([I]Of-the-Horse[/I]). Pegasos at once yielded his mouth to the magic bit, and the
              hero mounting him achieved his adventures.</p>
            <p>We do not well see how this narrative can be made to <pb n="404" xml:id="p404"
              />accord with the Homeric tale, which was however known to Pindar ; for there is not
              the slightest allusion in it to Prœtos and Anteia, or to Lycia, and the hero
              apparently sets out on his adventures from Corinth. It would not surprise us if the
              ancient form of the legend was that a prince of Corinth had, by the aid of a winged
              horse, ridden through the air, and achieved adventures in various parts of the
              world.</p>
            <p>But in reality the foundation of this mythe lies still deeper. In Bellerophontes we
              have only one of the forms of Poseidôn, namely as Hippios. This god is his father<note
                place="bottom">Pind. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> ver. 99. Sch. II. vi. 155. Glaucos
                is, like Ægeus, an epithet of the sea-god.</note> ; and he is also the sire of
                Pegasos<note place="bottom">See above, p. 253.</note> ; and in the two combined we
              have a Poseidôn-Hippios, the rider of the waves, — a symbol of the navigation of the
              ancient Ephyra. The adventures of the hero may have signified the real or imaginary
              perils to be encountered in voyages to distant countries ; and when the original sense
              of the mythe was lost, the <hi rend="i">King</hi> (Prœtos, <hi rend="i"
                >πρῶτος</hi>), and his wife <hi rend="i">Foe</hi> (Anteia, from <hi

                  rend="i">ἀντιάω</hi>.</note>, and the common lovetale were introduced to assign a
              cause for the adventures.</p>
            <p>In this mythe too we find that mysterious connexion between Poseidôn and
              Pallas-Athene and the horse more fully revealed than elsewhere. They are the parents
              of Pegasos (for Athena and Medusa are the same), that is, probably of the ship<note

            from those of Hellas Proper. The great patriarch of the latter was Deucaliôn, whose
            posterity were brought into connexion with the Cadmeians of Thebes and the Erechtheids
            of Attica, and to whom the principal legends of the north and west of the Peloponnese
            also refer. The Argive mythic history commences with the river Inachos and his son
            Phoroneus. It is, moreover, in this cycle alone that we find an attempt at connecting
            Greece and Egypt in the mythic period ; for, as we have shown above, the Egyptian origin

              By the nymph Laodice Phoroneus had a son named Apis, from whom the peninsula was named
              Apia ; and a daughter Niobe, the first mortal woman who enjoyed the love of Zeus. Her

              was however not yet satiated ; and she sent a gad-fly to torment Io, who fled over the
              whole world from its pursuits. She swam through the Ionian Sea, which derived its name
              from her ; then roamed over the plains of Illyria, ascended Mount Hæmus, and crossed
              the Thracian strait, thence named the Bosporos, rambled on through Scythia and the
              country of the Kimmerians ; and, after wandering over various regions of Europe and
              Asia, arrived at last on the banks of the Nile, where, <hi rend="i">touched</hi> by

            <p>The legend of Io would not appear to have attracted so much of the attention of the
              elder poets as might have been expected. Homer never alludes to it, unless his
              employment of the term Argeiphontes is to be regarded as intimating a knowledge of Io.
              It is also doubtful if she was one of the heroines of the Eoiæ. Her story however was
              noticed in the Ægimios, where it was said that her father's name was Peirên, that her
              keeper Argos had four eyes, and that the isle of Eubœa derived its name from her<note

            <p>This hypothesis appears to us to be more ingenious than true. Analogy would lead us
              to view in Io a form of the Argive goddess Hera, with whom she is so closely
              connected ; and as Hera is the earth, Io cannot well be the moon<note place="bottom"
                >Neither is Isis the moon. See above, p. 227.</note>. Io and Hera in this legend
              seem to stand in the same relation as Callisto and Artemis in one hereafter to be

              to watch the cow ; and Hermes the rural god kills him, as dogs are driven off or
              killed by the country-people. A gad-fly then persecutes the cow, and she runs wild all
              through the country. Such was perhaps the original simple legend, and it may have had
              its source in the notions of the loves, the marriages, the jealousies related of
              Hera.</p>
            <p>The wanderings of Io were gradually extended. The name of the Ionian sea caused her
              to be made to ramble along its shore ; when Byzantion was founded, there were Argives
              among the colonists, who carried with them their domestic legends, and in honour of Io
              they named the adjacent strait Bosporos (<hi rend="i">Cow-ford</hi>), feigning that
              she had swum across it<note place="bottom">Müller, Proleg. 133.</note>. A similar
              strait into the Mæotis received the same name, and Io of course had wandered thither.
              Finally, when the Greeks first settled in Egypt and saw the statues of Isis with cow's
              horns, they in their usual manner inferred that she was their own Io, with whose name
              hers had a slight similarity. At Memphis <pb n="409" xml:id="p409"/>they afterwards
              beheld the worship of the holy calf Apis, and naturally supposing the calf-god to be
              the son of the cowgoddess, they formed from him a son for their Io, whose name was the

            <p>Epaphos, the son of Io, is the instrument by which Grecian vanity derived the rulers

              Memphis the daughter of the Nile, by whom he had a daughter named Libya, who bore to
              Poseidon Agenor the father of Cadmos and Europa, and Belos, who had by another
              daughter of the Nile named Anchinoe two sons, Danaos and Ægyptos<note place="bottom"

            <p>Belos assigned the country of Libya to his son Danaos ; to Ægyptos he gave Arabia.

            <p>Danaos had by several wives an equal number of daughters. Dissension arising between
              him and the sons of Ægyptos, they aimed at depriving him of his dominions ; and
              fearing their violence, he built with the aid of Athena a fifty-oared vessel, — the
              first that was ever made, — in which he embarked with his daughters and fled over the
              sea. He first landed on the isle of Rhodes, where he set up a statue of the Lindian
              Athena ; but not willing to abide in that island, he proceeded to Argos, where
              Gelanôr, who at that time ruled over the country, cheerfully resigned the government
              to the stranger who brought thither civilization and the arts. The people took the

                trident at the satyr it stuck in a rock, and on the maiden’s drawing it forth at the
                command of the god three streams of water followed it.</note>.</p>
            <p>The sons of Ægyptos came now to Argos, and entreated their uncle to agree to bury in
              oblivion all enmity, and to give them their cousins in marriage. Danaos, retaining a
              perfect recollection of their injuries to him, and distrustful of their promises,
              consented to bestow his daughters on them, whom he divided among them by lot. But on
              the wedding-day he armed the hands of the brides with daggers, and enjoined them to
              slay in the night their unsuspecting bridegrooms. All but Hypermnestra obeyed the
              cruel orders of their father ; and cutting off the heads of their husbands, they flung
              them into Lerna, and buried their bodies with all due rites outside of the town. At
              the command of Zeus, Hermes and Athena purified them from the guilt of their deed.</p>

              close confinement. Relenting however after some time, he gave his consent to her union
              with Lynceus, and proclaimed gymnic games, in which the victors were to receive his
              other daughters as the prizes. It was said, however, that the crime of the Danaïdes
              did not pass without due punishment in the <pb n="411" xml:id="p411"/>underworld,
              where they were condemned to draw everlastingly water in perforated vessels<note

            <p>The son of Amymone by Poseidôn was called Nauplios. He attained a great age, and
              passed his time on the sea lamenting the fate of those who were lost in it. At length

            <p>In this celebrated legend we have a very heterogeneous mixture of peoples and
              countries. The city Memphis is very naturally called the daughter of the Nile, on
              whose banks it stood ; but Libya is preposterously made the daughter and Egypt the
              grandson of that city, and the Phœnician god Belos or Baal the father of Danaos and
              Ægyptos, i. e. the Argives and the Egyptians. The whole only serves to show the
              careless manner in which these national genealogies were fabricated.</p>
            <p>From what has been said above respecting Cadmos, the reader, we should hope, will be
              prepared to regard the tale of an Egyptian colony at Argos as somewhat suspicious. In
              fact there was no part of Greece more thoroughly Hellenic, none which had less
              similarity in religion or institutions with Egypt. Moreover the origin of Danaos and
              his family may be easily traced to the physical character of the land.</p>
            <p>In Homer and Hesiod Danaans is a common name of the Greeks, who are also called
              Argeians and Achæans. The names of nations have never, except among nomadic tribes,
              been derived from persons ; they always come from the character of the people or that
              of the soil<note place="bottom">In Plato's Laws (iv. 704.) it is said, respecting the
                name of the city to be founded, <hi rend="i">τοȗτο μὲν τάχ͐ ἄν ἴσως кαὶ</hi> ὁ <hi

                <hi rend="i">dry.</hi> We have here then a simple derivation for the name Danaans,

            <p>Lynceus succeeded his father-in-law on the throne. He had by Hypermnestra a son named
              Abas, to whom he left his kingdom. Abas had twin children, Prœtos and Acrisios, who
              struggled — ominous of their future discord — in their mother's womb. When they grew
              to be youths, they contended for the kingdom ; and on this occasion are said to have
              been the inventors of shields. Prœtos was worsted, and driven <pb n="413"

              Lycians to the Peloponnese, made him master of Tiryns, which the Cyclopes walled for
              him. Acrisios was now obliged to divide their paternal territory with Prœtos : he

              medicine, promised to restore them to their senses, if Prœtos would agree to give him
              a third of his kingdom. The demanded fee appeared out of all reason, and the father
              declined accepting the recovery of his daughters on such high terms. But speedily the
              madness of the maidens increased, and even extended to the other women, who killed
              their children, abandoned their houses, and fled to the wilds. The reluctance of
              Prœtos was now overcome : he offered to comply with the terms of Melampûs ; but the
                <hi rend="i">Mantis</hi> would not employ his art without another third of the realm
              being given to his brother Bias. Prœtos now, fearing that delay would only make him
              advance further in his demands, consented ; and the prophet set about the cure. He
              took a number of the ablest young men of the place, and made them with shouts and a
              certain inspired kind of dance chase the maidens from the mountains to Sicyôn. In the
              chase Iphinoe, the eldest of the Prœtides, died ; but the others were restored to
              sanity ; and Prœtos gave them in marriage to Melampûs and his brother Bias. He had

            <p>The madness of the Prœtides was sung in the Eoiæ, where it was ascribed to the

              anger of Hera ; the latter says that they made light of the statue of the
              goddess, — the former, that they ridiculed her temple, saying that their father's
              house was much finer. It was also said that they were the priestesses of the goddess
              and were punished by her for taking the gold off her robe and converting it to their

            <p>It is remarkable that the characteristic trait of their fancying themselves changed

              than that he did not invent it, and it has every appearance of being a part of the
              original mythe. In such case the legend of the Prœtides would have some analogy with
              that of Io.</p>

            <p>Acrisios married Eurydice the daughter of Lacedæmôn, by whom he had a daughter, whom
              he called Danae. He inquired of the oracle about a son ; and the god replied, that he
              would himself have no male issue, but that his daughter would bear a son whose hand
              would deprive him of life. Fearing the accomplishment of this prediction, he framed a

              which he shut up his daughter and her nurse, in order that she might never become a
              mother. But Zeus had seen and loved the maiden ; and under the form of a golden shower
              he poured through the roof down into her bosom. Danae became the mother of a son, whom
              she and her nurse reared in secrecy until he had attained his fourth year. Acrisios
              then chanced to hear the voice of the child at his play. He brought forth his daughter
              and her nurse ; and putting the latter instantly to death, drew Danae in private with
              her son to the altar of Herceian Zeus, where he made her answer on oath whose was her
              son. She replied that he was the offspring of Zeus. Her father gave no credit to her
              protestations. Inclosing her and her child in a coffer, he <pb n="415" xml:id="p415"

                the beautiful fragment of Simonides on the subject of Danae.</note>. The coffer
              floated to the little isle of Seriphos, where a man named Dictys drew it out in his
              nets (<hi rend="i">δίкτυα</hi>) ; and delivering Danae and Perseus, treated them with
              the kindest attention<note place="bottom">There was a legend in Italy that Ardea, the

            <p>Polydectes the brother of Dictys, who reigned over Seriphos, fell in love with
              Danae ; but her son Perseus, who was now grown up, was an invincible obstacle to the
              accomplishment of his wishes. He had therefore recourse to artifice to deliver himself
              of his presence ; and feigning that he was about to become a suitor to Hippodameia,
              the daughter of Œnomaos, he called together his vassals, and among them Perseus, to a
              banquet, and requested of them to contribute toward his bride-gift. Perseus inquiring
              what was the object of the banquet, Polydectes replied horses, and Perseus made answer
              that he would bring him even the head of the Gorgon. The king said nothing at the
              time ; but next day, when the rest brought each his horse, he desired Perseus to keep
              his word and fetch him the Gorgon’s head.</p>
            <p>Perseus full of grief retired to the extremity of the isle, where Hermes came to him,
              promising that he and Athena would be his guides. Hermes brought him first to the
              faircheeked Grææ, whose eye and tooth he stole, and would not restore until they had
              furnished him with directions to the abode of the Nymphs who were possessed of the
              winged shoes, the magic wallet, and the helmet of Hades which made the wearer
              invisible. The Grææ complied with his desire, and he came unto the Nymphs, who gave
              him their precious possessions : he then flung the wallet over his shoulder, placed
              the helmet on his head, and fitted the shoes to his feet. Thus equipped, and grasping
              the adamantine scimitar (<hi rend="i">harpe</hi>) which Hermes gave him, he mounted
              into the air, accompanied by the gods, and flew to the Ocean, where he found the three
              Gorgons fast asleep<note place="bottom">See p. 253.</note>. Fearing to gaze on their
              faces, which changed the beholder to stone, he looked on the head of <pb n="416"
                xml:id="p416"/>Medusa as it was reflected on his shield, and Athena guiding his hand
              he severed it from her body. The blood gushed forth, and with it the winged steed
              Pegasos and Chrysaôr the father of Geryoneus, for Medusa was at the time pregnant by
              Poseidôn. Perseus took up the head, put it into his wallet, and set out on his return.
              The two sisters awoke, and pursued the fugitive ; but protected by the helmet of Hades
              he eluded their vision, and they were obliged to give over the bootless chase<note

            <p>Perseus pursued his aërial journey till he came to the country of the Æthiopians<note
                place="bottom">This is probably the Æthiopia mentioned by Menelaos (Od. iv. 84.) in
                the Mediterranean, to which sea the Nereïdes were confined.</note>. Here he beheld
              Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus king of the country, fastened to a rock, a prey for
              a huge sea-monster<note place="bottom">The scene was localised at Joppa, where the
                marks of the chains were to be seen on a rock, as also the bones of the monster
                which M. Scaurus brought to Rome and exhibited in his ædileship. See Plin. H. N. ix.
                5. Strabo, i. 2. Mela, i. 11. Josephus, Bell. Jud. iii. 9, 3.</note>. Cassiopeia,
              the wife of Cepheus, having offended the Nereïdes by her presumption in setting
              herself before them in point of beauty, Poseidôn sympathized with the anger of the
              sea-maidens, and laid waste the realms of Cepheus by an inundation and a sea-monster.
              The oracle of Ammôn, on being consulted by Cepheus, declared that only by the exposure
              of Andromeda, the daughter of Cassiopeia, to the monster, could the evil be averted.
              The reluctance of Cepheus was forced to give way to the determination of his subjects,
              and the unhappy princess was bound to a rock. Perseus beholding her there, was seized
              with love, and he forthwith promised Cepheus to deliver his daughter from the monster
              if he would give her to him in marriage when saved. Cepheus joyfully consented, and
              each party swore to the agreement. Perseus then attacked and killed the monster, and
              delivered Andromeda ; but Phineus the brother of Cepheus, to whom the princess had
              been betrothed, plotted to destroy the hero ; who, coming to the knowledge of his
              designs, displayed the Gorgon’s head, and turned him and his partisans to stone.</p>
            <p>Perseus now proceeded to Seriphos, where he found that <pb n="417" xml:id="p417"/>his
              mother and Dictys had been obliged to fly to the protection of the altar from the
              violence of Polydectes. He immediately went to the royal residence ; and when at his
              desire Polydectes had summoned thither all the people to see the formidable head of
              the Gorgon, it was displayed, and each became a stone of the form and position which
              he exhibited at the moment of the transformation. Having established Dictys as king
              over Seriphos, Perseus returned the shoes, the wallet, and the helmet to Hermes, by
              whom they were brought back to the Nymphs. He gave the Gorgon’s head to Athena, who
              set it in the middle of her shield.</p>
            <p>Accompanied by his mother and his wife Andromeda, Perseus now set out for Argos ; but
              Acrisios, fearing the fulfilment of the oracle, left his kingdom, and retired to
              Larissa in Thessaly. Perseus went thither to persuade him to return to Argos. Acrisios
              consented ; but Teutamias, the king of Larissa, happening at that time to celebrate
              funeral games in honour of his father lately dead, Perseus engaged in them. As he was
              throwing the discus it fell on the foot of Acrisios, who died of the wound. After this
              unlooked-for fulfilment of the oracle, Perseus buried his grandfather before the city,
              and returned to the Peloponnese. But feeling ashamed to take the inheritance of one
              who had died by his means, he proposed an exchange of dominions with Megapenthes the
              son of Prœtos, and thenceforward reigned at Tiryns. He afterwards built and fortified
              Mycenæ and Mideia<note place="bottom">The whole preceding narrative, excepting the

            <p>According to Pindar, Athena conducted Perseus, when on his way to the Gorgons, to the

            <p>Andromeda bore to Perseus six sons and one daughter. The sons were Perses (who was
              born in Æthiopia, and being left with his grandfather became the ancestor of the kings

              Sthenelos and Eleios. The daughter was named Gorgophone ; she married Perieres the
              Laconian. From Perseus the royal line at Argos were named the Perseids.</p>
            <p>The mythe of Perseus is probably one of great antiquity. It is alluded to in the
                Ilias<note place="bottom">Il. xiv. 319.</note>, and in the Theogony<note
                place="bottom">Theog. 280.</note> the cutting off of Medusa's head is spoken of as a
              well-known event. There does not however appear to have ever been a poem solely
              dedicated to the adventures of Perseus, but it is likely they were related at length
              in the Eoiæ.</p>
            <p>A mythe so very ancient as this appears to be was probably a physical one in its
              origin, and this supposition is confirmed by many circumstances in the beautiful fairy
              tale under whose form it has been transmitted to us. But still it is extremely
              obscure, and we can only arrive at glimpses of the signification. The following
              conjectures may perhaps approach to probability.</p>
            <p>The cutting off the Gorgon’s head is the main action of the mythe, and Pallas-Athene
              aids the hero and enables him to achieve the adventure. This goddess was one of the
              most ancient deities of Argos, for she had a temple on the Larissa or citadel<note
                place="bottom">Paus. ii. 24, 3.</note>, whence she was named, like Hera, <hi
                rend="i">Of-the-Height</hi> (Ἀ<hi rend="i">кρία</hi> or A<hi rend="i"
                >кρίς</hi>)<note place="bottom">Hesychius. <hi rend="i">s. v.</hi></note>. Hence it
              is probable that, as at Athens, she was regarded as a physical power. Further, we
              invariably find the Gorgon (not the Gorgons) connected with this <pb n="419"
                xml:id="p419"/>goddess, and moreover Gorgo is one of her own appellations<note
                place="bottom">See the proofs, Appendix (L).</note>. The Grecian deities, as the
              authors of evil as well as good, were usually viewed under two different aspects, and
              hence Gorgo was probably the injurious, inimical Pallas. With respect to the other
              names in the mythe, Acrisios is apparently connected with the Larissa, the height (<hi
                rend="i">ἄкρον</hi>) where tradition said he lay buried<note place="bottom">Clem.
                Alex. Protrep. p. 29.</note> ; Danae seems to refer to the <hi rend="i">dry</hi>
              land, and Perseus to belong with Persephone and others to a family of words denoting
                <hi rend="i">light</hi> or <hi rend="i">feeding</hi><note place="bottom">See above,
                p. 180.</note>. Further, Polydectes is an epithet of Hades<note place="bottom">Hom.
                Hymn to Demeter, 9.</note>, of which Dictys (<hi rend="i">Netter</hi>) may be a
              kindred term. At Athens there was an altar of Dictys and Clymene at the <hi rend="i"
                >temenos</hi> of Perseus, as being his deliverers<note place="bottom">Paus. ii. 18,
                1.</note> ; which seems to identify Dictys with Hades, and that apparently under a
              beneficent point of view.</p>
            <p>Müller therefore thus explains the mythe<note place="bottom">Proleg. 307. <hi

                (see above, p. 32.), but the ancient Cyclopian treasuries appear to have been lined
                with brass. See Leake, Travels in the Morea.</note> ; Zeus descends in a golden
              fructifying shower, and Perseus is born. But the god of the under-world will take
              Danae, that is cover the land with gloom. This is prevented by Perseus’ freeing the
              goddess from her opposite the Gorgo, which makes the moonbeams poisonous and petrifies
              the land. The efficacy of her look is then directed against the under-world itself,
              and restrains its power in the depths of the earth. The beneficent deity, the rearer
              of trees and corn, recovers her full influence, and the clear fructifying springs
              represented by Pegasos gush forth.</p>
            <p>This explanation is ingenious but deficient in simplicity. There seems to us to be an
              error in supposing Athena to be always the ‘Athenian Maid’, and therefore the moon.
              The mythe of Danae and Perseus being manifestly one of great antiquity and peculiar to
              Argos, we should feel rather disposed to see the Argive goddess in the Athena who
              appears in it. As this goddess was the earth, the mythe in this view <pb n="420"
                xml:id="p420"/>forms a parallel to that of Demeter-Erinnys<note place="bottom">See
                above, p. 178.</note>, and Pegasos corresponds with Areiôn. The opposite characters
              of the soil of Argos and Arcadia will account for the different forms of the mythic
              narratives.</p>
            <p>We have already hinted that mythes were generally very simple in their origin, and
              gained, like streams, in their progress. It is probable that this of Perseus at first
              consisted of no more than the account of his birth and the killing of the Gorgon
                Medusa<note place="bottom">Medusa, i. e. <hi rend="i">Mistress</hi>, answers to the
                Arcadian Despœna. See above, p. 179.</note>, and that the exposure in the sea, the
              two immortal Gorgons, Andromeda, and so forth, were posterior additions. Pallas-Athene
              having become the guide of heroes at the time when the mythe was extended, she may
              have been substituted for the original goddess<note place="bottom">See above, p. 326.
                  <hi rend="i">note</hi>ª.</note>. We cannot believe that Hades ever belonged to the
              mythe ; the names Dictys and Polydectes are sufficiently explained by the story.</p>

            <p>Perseus was succeeded by his son Alcæos, who had a son named Amphitryôn. Alcæos left
              the throne to his brother Electryôn, who had married his daughter Anaxo, by whom he
              had several children.</p>
            <p>Mestôr, the third son of Perseus, married Lysidice the daughter of Pelops, by whom he
              had a daughter named Hippothoe, whom Poseidôn carried off to the Echinadian isles. She
              there bore him a son named Taphios, who settled at Taphos, and called his people
              Teleboans, because he had gone <hi rend="i">far</hi> from his native land<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">ὅτι τη</hi>λ<hi rend="i">οȗ ἔβη.</hi></note>. He had a
              son named Pterolaos, whom Poseidôn made immortal by setting a golden lock of hair on
              his head. Pterolaos had several sons, and one daughter who was named Comætho (<hi
                rend="i">Hair-burner</hi>).</p>
            <p>When Electryôn succeeded to the throne of Mycenæ, the sons of Pterolaos came with an
              army of Taphians, and claimed it in right of their great-grandfather Mestôr, who was
              elder brother to Electryôn ; and on his refusal to comply with their demands, they
              drove off his cows. The sons of Electryôn <pb n="421" xml:id="p421"/>came to the
              rescue of their cattle. A fight ensued, in which all the sons of Electryôn met their
              death except Licymnios, who was still a child, and all the sons of Pterolaos fell but
              Eueres, who was in charge of their ships. The Taphians fled in their vessels, leaving
              the cattle, which they had driven away, in the charge of Polyxenes king of the
              Eleians. Amphitryôn pursued them to Elis, and redeemed them ; for Electryôn, desirous
              to avenge the death of his sons, had given to Amphitryôn the kingdom and his daughter
              Alcmena, binding him by oath not to claim a husband’s rights until he had returned
              from his expedition against the Teleboans. But as Amphitryôn was driving home the
              cattle which he had recovered, one of the cows chancing to run aside, he flung the
              stick he had in his hand after her, which happening to strike Electryôn on the head
              killed him. Sthenelos, the fifth son of Perseus, taking advantage of this unlucky
              deed, drove Amphitryôn from Mycenæ and Tiryns ; and sending for his nephews Atreus and
              Thyestes, the sons of Pelops, settled them at Mideia.</p>
            <p>Amphitryôn, accompanied by his wife Alcmena and her half-brother Licymnios, retired
              to Thebes, where he was purified by Creôn, who gave his daughter Perimede in marriage
              to Licymnios. Alcmena still refusing to admit the embraces of Amphitryôn till he had
              avenged her brothers, he applied to Creôn to assist him in the war. To this Creôn
              assented, on condition of his guest’s first freeing Cadmeia from the fox which ravaged
              it, and which was fated never to be caught. To this animal the Thebans were obliged to
              give a child every month, to save the rest. Amphitryôn undertook the task, and with
              the aid of Cephalos and his dog succeeded<note place="bottom">See above,
                p. 382.</note>.</p>
            <p>Strengthened by a number of auxiliaries, Amphytriôn now went against the Teleboans.
              He landed, and ravaged their islands ; but so long as Pterolaos lived, he could
              accomplish nothing. At length Comætho, the daughter of that prince, falling in love
              with Amphitryôn, pulled out the fatal golden lock, and he died, and the islands were
                conquered<note place="bottom">See above, p. 385. We may here observe that the

            <p>Asclepios is called by Homer an excellent physician (T<hi rend="i">άνταλος</hi>), who
              had been instructed by Cheirôn. His sons Podaleirios and Machaôn, who were also
              renowned for their skill in treating wounds, led to Troy the men of Tricca, Ithome and
              Œchalia in northern Thessaly<note place="bottom">Il. ii. 731 ; iv. 194. 219 ; xi.

            <p>As has been already related<note place="bottom">See above, p. 119.</note>, Asclepios
              was the son of Apollo by Coronis the daughter of Phlegyas. The care of his education
              was committed to Cheirôn, who taught him the healing art<note place="bottom">Pind.

              as to be able to restore life to the dead. He is said to have thus recalled from the

              for which deed he was banished from Olympos.</p>
            <p>The tradition at Epidaurus (the great seat of the worship of Asclepios) was that
              Phlegyas, having come to explore the strength of the Peloponnese, was accompanied by
              his daughter, who was at the time pregnant by Apollo, but unknown to her father. Her
              labour came on in the country of Epidaurus, and she exposed the babe on Mount Myrtion,
              afterwards named Titthion (<hi rend="i">τίτθη a nurse</hi>). Here one of the goats
              that fed on the mountain gave it suck, and the goatherd’s dog kept guard over it. The
              herdsman, missing his dog and goat, went in search of them. He thus discovered the
              babe, and on approaching to take it up he perceived that its body emitted a <pb
                n="423" xml:id="p423"/>brilliant light, at which proof of divinity he drew back. The
              fame of the healing powers of the wonderful child was quickly spread over sea and
                land<note place="bottom">Paus. ii. 26, 3-5.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Messenians asserted that Asclepios first saw the light in <hi rend="i">their</hi>
              country. His mother was Arsinoe the daughter of Leucippos, and the places from which
              his sons led the troops to Troy were in Messene, and not in Thessaly. They showed at
              Gerenia the tomb of Machaôn, and at Pharæ the temple of his children<note

                Sch. Pind. Pyth. iii. 14.</note>.</p>
            <p>Asclepios was one of those who sailed in the Argo. He had by Lampetia the daughter of
              the Sun two sons, Machaôn and Podaleirios, and three daughters, Panakeia (<hi rend="i"
                >All-heal</hi>), Iaso (<hi rend="i">Health</hi>), and Ægle (<hi rend="i"

                Aristoph. Plut. 701.</note>.</p>
            <p>At Epidaurus Asclepios was represented under the form of an old man with a venerable
              beard, wrapt in a mantle and leaning on a staff round which a serpent was twined. It
              was said that when he was about to raise Glaucos a serpent came and crept to his
              staff ; he struck and killed it. Soon after another serpent came, bearing a herb in
              its mouth, which it laid on the head of the dead one, who instantly recovered.
              Asclepios took the herb and by means of it restored Glaucos<note place="bottom">Hygin.
                P. A. ii. 14.</note>. Others said that Athena had given him the blood of the Gorgon,

              of the right side he cured them<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 10, 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>From all that is related of Asclepios it is plain that he was an original deity,
              probably of the Phlegyans or Lapiths. There is much resemblance between him and
              Trophonios. His union with Apollo is merely mythologie, as they were never worshiped
              together. It is probably founded on the epithet Paan of this god<note place="bottom"

              was by the Oceanis Melibœa or the nymph Cyllene the father of Lycaôn king of
              Arcadia.</p>
            <p>Lycaôn had many wives, by whom he became the father of fifty sons, who were like
              himself impious and cruel. Zeus, to satisfy himself of the truth of the reports that
              reached him, disguised himself as a poor man and sought their hospitality. To
              entertain the stranger they slaughtered a boy, and mingling his flesh with that of the
              victims, set it before their guest. The god, in indignation and horror at the
              barbarous act, overturned the <hi rend="i">table</hi> (whence the place derived its
              future name of Trapezôs), and struck with lightning the godless father and sons, with
              the exception of Nyctimos, whom Earth, raising her hands and grasping the right-hand
              of Zeus, saved from the wrath of the avenging deity. According to another account,
              Zeus destroyed the dwelling of Lycaôn with lightning, and turned its master into a
              wolf. The deluge of Deucaliôn which shortly afterwards occurred is ascribed to the
              impiety of the sons of Lycaôn<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 8. Ovid, Met. i. 216.

            <pb n="425" xml:id="p425"/><p>In Arcadia Zeus was worshiped under the title of Lycæos on
              the summit of Mount Lycæon, at the foot of which stood the town of Lycosura, said to
              have been built by Lycaôn, who established there games called Lycæa<note
                place="bottom">Paus. viii. 2, 1.</note>. At Mount Lycæon there was a sacred
              inclosure or <hi rend="i">temenos</hi> of Zeus, within which neither man nor beast
              cast a shadow, and any one who entered it designedly was put to death<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id. ib.</hi>38, 6. Plut. Q. G. 39.</note>. These names
              and circumstances might lead to the supposition that Zeus Lycæos was in Arcadia what
              Apollo Lycios was elsewhere ; and that the true root in this case also was ATKH, <hi
                rend="i">lux, light</hi> ; and similarity of sound gave occasion to the legends of
              wolves, of which there were many in Arcadia. In this case Lycaôn would be only another
              name for Zeus, to whom he raised an altar, and he could not therefore have been
              described as impious in the primitive legend. The opposition between his name and that
              of Nyctimos strongly confirms this hypothesis. It may indeed be said that Zeus derived
              his appellation from the mountain ; but against this is to be observed, that there was
              an eminence in the territory of Cyrene or Barce in Libya dedicated to Zeus Lycæos<note

              But Zeus saw and loved Callisto ; and changing himself into the form of the
              huntress-goddess, accompanied the maiden to the chase, and surprised her virtue. She
              long concealed her shame ; but at length, as she was one day bathing with her divine
              mistress, the alteration in her person was observed ; and Artemis, in her anger,
              turned her into a bear. While in this form she brought forth her son Arcas, who lived
              with her in the woods, till the herdsmen caught both her and him, and brought them to

              snatched her out of their hands, and placed her as a constellation in the sky<note

            <p>This fable is narrated with great difference in the circumstances. Some say it was
              the form of Apollo that Zeus took. In some versions it is Zeus who turns Callisto into
              a bear to conceal her from Hera ; and this goddess persuades Artemis to kill her with
              her arrows as a noxious beast ; Zeus then, it is said, took the unborn infant and gave
              it to Maia to rear. It is also said that Areas, having been separated from his mother
              and reared among men, meeting her one day in the woods, was on the point of slaying
              her, when Zeus transferred the mother and son to the skies. Finally it was, according
              to others, Hera herself who transformed Callisto<note place="bottom">Apollod. <hi

            <p>Arcas succeeded Nyctimos in the government. He was the friend of Triptolemos, who
              taught him agriculture, which he introduced into his country, now called from himself
              Arcadia, and instructed its inhabitants in the mode of making bread. He also showed
              them how to manufacture wool, — an art which he learned from Aristæos<note
                place="bottom">Paus. viii. I, I.</note>.</p>
            <p>In Callisto we have another instance of the practice of converting an epithet into an
              attendant. On the way from the town to the Academy at Athens there was an inclosure
              sacred to Artemis, in which were wooden statues of Ariste and Calliste. These
              Pausanias (who says he is borne out by some verses of Sappho) regarded merely as
              epithets of the goddess<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> i. 29, 2.</note>. He
              further tells us<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Id.</hi> viii. 35, 8.</note> that in
              Arcadia, on a large mound planted with various kinds of trees, and named the Tomb of
              Callisto, stood a temple of Artemis-Calliste ; and he adds that it was the ancient
              poet Pamphôs who first gave Artemis this epithet in his verses, having learned it from
              the Arcadians. <pb n="427" xml:id="p427"/>When we add that the <hi rend="i"
                >Fair-one</hi> (<hi rend="i">ἁ κλὰ</hi>) is a frequent epithet of Artemis in the
              Attic drama, little doubt, we should think, will remain of the identity of Artemis and
                Callisto<note place="bottom">Sce Müller, Proleg. 73. <hi rend="i"
              >seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>From the analogy between Io and Callisto, it seems to follow that the bear was sacred
              to Artemis. This is strongly confirmed by the fact that at Braurôn in Attica young
              girls between the age of five and ten years, and called <hi rend="i">Bears</hi> (<hi
                rend="i">ἄρκτοι</hi>), used to perform the sacred rites of this goddess, on which
              occasion they went round the temple clad in yellow, imitating bears. One of the
              reasons assigned for the origin of this custom was, that Braurôn, not Aulis, was the
              scene of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and that it was a bear, not a hind, that had
              been substituted<note place="bottom">Sch. Aristoph. Lys. 645. Suidas, <hi rend="i">v.

              he exposed the babe in the mountains, where she was suckled by a bear, and at last
              found by some hunters, who named her Atalanta and reared her. She followed the chase,
              and was alike distinguished for beauty and courage. The Centaurs Rhœcos and Hylæos
              attempting her honour perished by her arrows. She took a part in the Argonautic
              expedition, was at the Calydo-nian hunt ; and at the funeral games of Pelias she won
              the prize in wrestling from Peleus<note place="bottom">Apollod. iii. 9, 2. Callim.

            <p>Atalanta was afterwards recognised by her parents. Her father wishing her to marry,
              she consented, but only on condition that her suitors should run a race with her in
              the following manner. She was to be armed, and the suitor to have the odds ; if she
              overtook him she was to kill him, if not he was to win her hand. Many had thus run and
              perished, and <pb n="428" xml:id="p428"/>their heads were fixed round the place of
              contest, when her cousin Meilaniôn offered himself to contend. He had three golden
              apples, which Aphrodite had given him ; these he threw as he ran ; Atalanta went out
              of the course to pick them up, and Meilaniôn won the race. Atalanta became his wife,
              and they had a son named Parthenopæos. It is added that they afterwards profaned the
                <hi rend="i">temenos</hi> of Zeus with their love, for which offence they were

              had, by Diomede the daughter of Lapithas, Cynortes and Hyacinthos. Cynortes left a son
              named Perieres, who was, by Gorgophone the daughter of Perseus, father of Tyndareos,
              Icarios, Aphareus, and Leucippos. According to others, the two last and Œbalos were
              the sons of Perieres, and Œbalos was the father of Tyndareos, Icarios, and

            <p>There are different accounts of the birth and parentage of the celebrated Helena. The
              common and probably the most ancient one is that given above, that she was the
              daughter of Leda by Zeus, who took the form of a white swan. According to the Cypria
              she was the offspring of Zeus and Nemesis, <pb n="430" xml:id="p430"/>who had long
              fled the pursuit of the god, and to elude him had taken the form of all kinds of
                animals<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Ap.</hi> Athen. viii. 334.</note>. At
              length, while she was under that of a goose, the god became a swan, and she laid an
              egg, which was found by a shepherd in the woods. He brought it to Leda, who laid it up
              in a coffer, and in due time Helena was produced from it<note place="bottom"
                  ><p>Apollod. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> These circumstances are not in the fragment
                  of the Cypria, but they were probably contained in the poem. Sappho said (<hi

                    ϵὑρȋν.</l></quote></note>. Hesiod, on the other hand, called Helena the daughter
              of Oceanos and Tethys<note place="bottom"><p>t was probably the war of Troy that made
                  Nemesis the mother of Helena.</p><p>Sch. Pind. Nem. x. 150.</p></note>.</p>
            <p>In the Ilias Helena is termed ‘begotten of Zeus<note place="bottom">Il. iii.
                418.</note>,’ and she calls Castôr and Polydeukes her ‘own-brothers whom one mother

                place="bottom">Od. xi. 298.</note> these are expressly called the sons of Tyndareos.
              This however does not prove that Helena was held to be his daughter ; and we shall see
              reason for supposing that she was always viewed as the child of Zeus.</p>
            <p>The beauty of Helena is proverbial. Theseus carried her off while yet a child, and,
              as we shall see, her frailty caused the war of Troy. It was fabled that after death

            <p>The earliest exploit of these twin heroes, who were born at Amyclæ, was the recovery
              of their sister Helena from the power of Theseus, whose mother Æthra they dragged in
              return into captivity. They took part in all the great undertakings of their time,
              were at the Calydonian hunt, accompanied Heracles against the Amazons, sailed in the
              Argo, and aided Peleus to storm Iolcos. Polydeukes was the most distinguished
              pugilist, Castôr the most expert charioteer, of his day. Hermes bestowed on them the
              fleet steeds Phlogios and <pb n="431" xml:id="p431"/>Harpagos, the children of the
              Harpy Podarge : Hera gave, them the swift Xanthos and Cyllaros.</p>
            <p>The brothers themselves fell into the very same offence which they had punished in
              Theseus. Being invited to the wedding-feast by their cousins Idas and Lynceus the sons
              of Aphareus, who had married their cousins Phœbe and Hilaeira the daughters of
              Leucippos, they became enamoured of the brides, and carried them off. Idas and his
              brother pursued the ravishers. In the conflict Castôr fell by the spear of Idas ; and
              Polydeukes, aided by the thunder of Zeus, slew the two sons of Aphareus<note
                place="bottom">Sch. Il. iii. 243. Sch. Pind. Nem. x. 112. Hygin. 80.</note>.</p>
            <p>Another account says that the four heroes joined to drive off the herds of the
              Arcadians. Idas was appointed to divide the booty. He killed an ox ; and dividing it
              into four parts, said that one half of the prey should fall to him who had first eaten
              his share, and the remainder to him who next finished. He then quickly devoured his
              own and his brother's part, and drove the whole herd to Messene. The Dioscuri (<hi
                rend="i">Zeus-sons</hi>), as Castôr and his brother were called, made war on
              Messene. Driving off all the cattle which they met, they laid themselves in ambush in
              a hollow tree ; but Lynceus, whose vision could penetrate the trees and the rocks,
              ascended the top of Taÿgeton, and looking over all the Peloponnese saw them there ;
              and he and his brother hastened to attack them. Castôr fell by the spear of Idas ;
              Polydeukes pursued the slayers, and coming up with them at the tomb of their father
              Aphareus, was struck by them in the breast with the pillar belonging to it. Unretarded
              by the blow, he rushed on, and killed Lynceus with his spear ; and Zeus, at the same
              moment, struck Idas with a thunderbolt<note place="bottom"><quote><l> Αἶ<hi rend="i"

            <p>Tyro the daughter of Salmoneus was, after the death of her father, brought up in
              Thessaly by his brother Deïôn. She was in love with the river Enipeus, to whose waves
              she often made her moan. Poseidôn saw and loved her ; and assuming the form of the
              river-god, embraced her at the mouth of the stream, whose bright waves arched over
              them, concealing the god and the mortal maid. The god declared then who he was, and
              enjoining secrecy dived into the sea. Tyro conceived from the divine embrace two sons,
              whom when born <pb n="435" xml:id="p435"/>she exposed. A troop of mares, followed by
              the herdsmen, passing by where they lay, one of the mares touched the face of one of
              the infants with her hoof, and made it <hi rend="i">livid</hi> (π<hi rend="i"

              one with the mark Pelias, the other Neleus. When they grew up they discovered their
              mother, and resolved to kill her stepmother Sidero, by whom she was cruelly treated.
              They pursued her to the altar of Hera ; and Pelias, who never showed any regard for
              that goddess, slew her before it. The brothers afterwards fell into discord, and
              Pelias abode at Iolcos, but Neleus settled in Elis, where he built a town named Pylos.
              Tyro afterwards married her uncle Cretheus, to whom she bore three sons, Æsôn, Pheres,
              and Amythaôn<note place="bottom">Od. xi. 235. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Apollod. <hi

            <p>Amythaôn the son of Cretheus and Tyro settled at Pylos. He married Eidomene the
              daughter of his brother Pheres, by whom he had two sons, Bias and Melampûs. This last
              lived in the country. Before his house stood an oak-tree, in a hole of which abode
              some serpents. His servants finding these animals, killed the old ones, whose bodies
              Melampûs burned ; but he saved and reared the young ones. As he was sleeping one day,
              these serpents, which were now grown to full size, came, and getting each on one of
              his shoulders, licked his ears with their tongues. He awoke in some terror ; and to
              his astonishment, found that he understood the voices of the birds which were flying
              around ; and learning from their tongues the future, he was able to declare it to
              mankind. Meeting Apollo on the banks of the Alpheios, he was taught by him the art of
              reading futurity in the entrails of victims, and he thus became an excellent
                soothsayer<note place="bottom">Apollod. i. 9. 11. Sch. Apoll. Rh. i.

            <p>Meanwhile his brother Bias fell in love with Pero the daughter of Neleus. As the hand
              of this beautiful maiden was sought by most of the neighbouring princes, her father
              declared that he would give her only to him who should bring him from Thessaly the
              cows of his mother Tyro, which Iphiclos of Phylace detained, and had them guarded by a
              dog whom neither man nor beast could venture to approach. Bias, relying on the aid of
              his brother, undertook the adventure. Melampûs, previously declaring that he knew he
              should be caught and confined for a year but then get the cattle, set out for Phylace.
              Everything fell out as he had said. The herdsmen of Iphiclos took him, and he was
              thrown into prison, where he was attended by a man and a woman. The man served <pb
                n="437" xml:id="p437"/>him well, the woman badly. Toward the end of the year he
              heard the worms in the timber conversing with each other. One asked how much of the
              beam was now gnawed through ; the others replied that there was little remaining.
              Melampûs immediately desired to be removed to some other place ; the man took up the
              bad at the head, the woman at the foot, Melampûs himself at the middle. They had not
              gotten quite out of the house, when the roof fell in and killed the woman. This coming
              to the ears of Iphiclos, he inquired, and learned that Melampûs was a <hi rend="i"
                >Mantis.</hi> He therefore, as he was childless, consulted him about having
              offspring. Melampûs agreed to tell him, on condition of his giving him the cows. The
              seer then sacrificing an ox to Zeus, divided it, and called all the birds to the
              feast. All came but the vulture ; but none was able to tell how Iphiclos might have
              children. They therefore brought the vulture, who said that Phylacos the father of
              Iphiclos had pursued him with a knife when he was a child, for having done something
              unseemly ; but not being able to catch him, had stuck the knife in a wild pear-tree,
              where the bark grew over it. The terror, he said, had deprived Iphiclos of his
              generative power ; but if this knife was gotten, and Iphiclos, scraping off the rust,
              drank it for ten mornings, he would have a child. All was done as the prophet desired,
              and Iphiclos had a son named Podarkes. Melampûs drove the kine to Pylos, and Pero was
              given to his brother<note place="bottom">Od. xi. 287. Sch. <hi rend="i">in loc.</hi>

            <p>The nymph Pitane, the daughter of the river-god Eurotas’ conceived by Poseidôn the
              ‘violet-tressed’ Euadne. She concealed her state ; and when the babe was born sent it
              to Æpytos, the son of Elatos the son of Areas, who dwelt at Phæsane on the banks of
              the Alpheios in Arcadia. When Euadne grew up, her charms attracted the love of Apollo.
              The consequence of her intercourse with the god did not escape the observation of
              Æpytos ; who, filled with anger and concern, journeyed to Pytho, to consult the oracle
              about this unhappy affair. While he was absent, Euadne, who had gone to the fount,
              felt her pains come on. She laid down her silver pitcher and loosed her
              ‘purple-yellow’ girdle, and beneath the dark foliage brought forth her ‘divine-minded’
              son. The ‘gold-haired’ god had sent the mild Eleutho and the Moiræ to ease her labour,
              and bring his offspring to the light. The mourning mother left her new-born babe on
              the ground, and two ‘green-eyed’ serpents came by the direction of the gods, and fed
              him on ‘the innocuous venom (<hi rend="i">ἰὸν</hi>) of bees.’</p>
            <p>When Æpytos returned from ‘rocky’ Pytho, he inquired after the child which Euadne had
              borne ; for Phœbos, he said, had told him that he would be a renowned prophet, and
              that his race would never fail. All declared that they had seen or heard nothing of
              the babe, who was now five days old, but lay concealed in the rushes and extensive
              thicket, ‘his tender body bedewed with the yellow and purple rays’ <hi rend="i">i.

            <p>On attaining ‘the fruit of pleasing gold-crowned youth,’ Iamos went into the stream
              of the Alpheios ; and by night in the open air called on Poseidôn his ‘wide-powerful’
              ancestor, and on ‘the bow-bearing guardian of god-built Delos,’ to grant him public
              honour. The voice of his father replied, directing him to follow ; and unseen, he
              brought him to the hill of Kronos at Olympia, where he gave him the double treasure of
              prophecy by augury and by entrail-inspection. When Heracles came to Olympia, and
              established the festival <pb n="439" xml:id="p439"/>of Zeus, Iamos by his direction
              founded a temple, at which he and his posterity the Iamids continued to officiate<note

            <p>The Theban bard here sings the mythic origin which had been assigned to the
              soothsaying Iamids of Olympia. The tradition appears to have been that they came from
              Arcadia. Poseidôn, we may observe, is placed at the head of the genealogies of both
              them and the Melampids ; and we are to recollect the soothsaying properties of the
              water-deities, and the inspiring influence of streams and founts<note place="bottom"

            <p>In the legendary annals of Elis, Endymiôn was the son of Aëthlios, the son of Zeus by

              father of Pæôn, Epeios and Ætolos. He proposed the succession to the kingdom as the
              prize of a race to his sons ; Epeios won, and the people were named from him ; Pæôn
              retired in resentment to the banks of the Axios, far away in the north, and the
              country there derived from him its name, Pæonia<note place="bottom">Paus. v.

            <p>Endymiôn, it is also said, gained the love of the goddess Selene, and she bore him
              fifty daughters<note place="bottom">Paus. <hi rend="i">ut supra.</hi></note>. Zeus as

              or as others said, granted him the boon of perpetual sleep. The place of his repose
              was a cavern of Mount Latmos in Caria, and thither Selene used to repair to visit him.
              Some said he was made immortal for his righteousness ; others that, like Ixiôn, when
              raised to heaven he made love to Hera, was deceived by a cloud, and was hurled to
                Erebos<note place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> from Hesiod,

            <p>There can be very little doubt that this mysterious being <pb n="440" xml:id="p440"
              />was originally an object of worship, and that he was converted into a hero in the
              usual manner. As the ancient Epeians are said to have been Lelegians, and this people
              also dwelt in the neighbourhood of Latmos, it has been thought<note place="bottom"
                >Müller, Proleg. 223.</note>, with much probability, that Endymiôn was a deity whom
              they worshiped. The sire assigned him is nothing more than a personification of the
              Olympic games (<hi rend="i">ἄϵθλα</hi>) ; his sons express the kindred between the
              Epeians and Ætolians. His union with the moon, and their fifty daughters, will perhaps
              furnish a key to his true nature. In these daughters Boeckh<note place="bottom">On
                Pind. O1. iii. 18.</note> sees the fifty lunar months which formed the Olympic cycle
              of four years. In such case Endymiôn would probably be the sun, who with the moon is
              the author of the months ; or supposing this to have been a Lelegian mythe, and
              therefore long anterior to the institution of the Olympic games, the daughters may
              have been the weeks of the year (the round number being employed as usual), of which
              the sun and moon are the parents. The conjunction of these bodies at the time of
              new-moon is a matter of common observation. Milton uses a very remarkable expression
              when he speaks of the moon as being at this time ‘hid in her vacant interlunar <hi

                into</hi> (<hi rend="i">ἐνδύϵι</hi>) the sea, or possibly in the Lelegian mythe the
              cavern where he meets the moon.</p>
            <p>The rationalisers said that Endymiôn was a hunter who used to go to the chase at
              night when the beasts came out to feed, and to sleep in a cavern during the day ; and

            <p>Pindar says that if ever mortal man was honoured by the dwellers of Olympos it was
              Tantalos ; but that he could not digest his happiness. They admitted him, he adds, to
              feast at their table on nectar and ambrosia, which made him immortal ; but he stole
              some of the divine food and gave it to his friends on earth. For this Zeus hung a
              stone over his head, which always menacing to descend and crush him deprives him of
              all joy<note place="bottom">Pind. Ol. i. 85. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. This poet
              does not mention the place of his punishment, but Euripides says that it was the air
              between heaven and earth, and that the rock was suspended over him by golden
                chains<note place="bottom">Orest. 6. 7. 972. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. The
              offence of Tantalos, according to him, was his not restraining his tongue, that is,
              probably his divulging the secrets of the gods.</p>
            <p>Tantalos was said to be the son of Zeus by the nymph Pluto (<hi rend="i"
              >Wealth</hi>), and he was the father of Pelops and of Niobe the wife of Amphiôn. His
              residence was placed at the foot of Mount Sipylos in Lydia. Zeus, said another legend,
              cast this mountain atop of him ; for Pandareos having stolen the golden dog which had
              guarded the goat that reared the god, gave it to Tantalos to keep. Hermes being sent
              to reclaim the dog, Tantalos denied all knowledge of it, and for his falsehood the
              mountain was thrown on him<note place="bottom">Sch. Pind. Ol. i. 97. Anton.

            <p>This last trifling legend is, as we may easily see, one of the <pb n="443"

              Homeric picture livelily exhibits the misery of such a state, and this is probably the
              more ancient form of the legend. The other form<note place="bottom">Archilochus was

              be, as has been ingeniously conjectured, an image of the evils of ambition and the
              inordinate pursuit of honours ; for when Tantalos, it was said, had attained his
              ultimate desire, and was admitted to the table of the gods, his joy was converted into
              terror by his fancying a rock suspended over his head and ready to crush him, and he
              sought permission to resign his place at the celestial table<note place="bottom"

            <p>At an entertainment given to the gods by Tantalos, he is said to have killed and
              dressed his son Pelops, and to have set him for food before them. Demeter had eaten
              one of the shoulders before the gods were aware of the horrid banquet of which they
              were about to partake. At the desire of Zeus, Hermes put all the parts back into the
              pot, and drew forth from it the boy perfect in all but the shoulder, which was
              replaced by an ivory one<note place="bottom">Sch. Pind. Ol. i. 38.</note>. Poseidôn,
              smitten with the beauty of Pelops, carried him off in his golden car to Olympos. But
              when his father had drawn on himself the indignation of the <pb n="444" xml:id="p444"
              />gods, they set Pelops once more among the ‘swift-fated race of men<note
                place="bottom">Pind. Ol. i. 60. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.’</p>
            <p>When Pelops had attained to manhood he resolved to seek in marriage Hippodameia, the
              daughter of Œnomaos, son of Ares, king of Pisa. An oracle having told this prince that
              he would lose his life through his son-in-law, or, as others say, being unwilling on
              account of her surpassing beauty to part with her, he proclaimed that he would give
              his daughter only to him who should conquer him in the chariot-race. The race was from
              the banks of the Cladios in Elis to the altar of Poseidôn at the Isthmus, and it was
              run in this manner : Œnomaos placing his daughter in the chariot with the suitor, gave
              him the start ; he followed himself with a spear in his hand, and if he overtook the
              unhappy lover ran him through. Thirteen had already lost their lives when Pelops
                came<note place="bottom">Sch. Pind. Ol. i. 114. Hygin. 84. Diodor. iv.
              73.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the dead of the night, says Pindar, Pelops went down to the margin of the sea, and
              invoked the god who rules it. Suddenly Poseidôn stood at his feet, and he conjured him
              by the memory of his affection to grant him the means of obtaining the lovely daughter
              of Œnomaos, declaring that even should he fail in the attempt, he regarded fame beyond
              inglorious old-age. Poseidôn assented to his prayer, and bestowed on him a golden
              chariot, and horses of winged speed<note place="bottom">Pind. Ol. i. 114. <hi rend="i"
                  >seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Pelops then went to Pisa to contend for the fair prize. He bribed Myrtilos, the son
              of Hermes, the charioteer of Œnomaos, to leave out the linch-pins of the wheels of his
              chariot, or as others said to put in waxen ones instead of iron. In the race
              therefore, the chariot of Œnomaos broke down, and falling out he was killed<note

              Pelops. To celebrate the wedding Poseidôn assembled the Nereïdes, and raised on the
              strand of the sea a bridal-chamber of the waves, which arched in bright curves over
              the marriagebed<note place="bottom">Himerius, Or. i. 6.</note>.</p>
            <p>Pelops is said<note place="bottom">Hygin. <hi rend="i">ut supra.</hi></note> to have

              as other accounts have it, to give him a share in the favours of Hippodameia.
              Unwilling, however, to keep his promise, he took an opportunity as they were driving
              along a cliff to throw Myrtilos into the sea, where he was drowned. Others say, that
              Hippodameia being thirsty, Pelops went in search of water for her ; during his absence
              Myrtilos attempted to offer her violence<note place="bottom">Tzetz. <hi rend="i">ut
                  supra.</hi></note>, and Pelops on her complaint flung him into the sea<note
                place="bottom">The Myrtoan sea was said to derive its name from him. Euripides
                (Orest. 984. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>) makes the deed to take place at Cape Geræstos
                in Eubœa.</note>. To the vengeance of Hermes for the death of his son were ascribed

            <p>Hippodameia bore to Pelops five sons, Atreus, Thyestes, Copreus, Alcathoös and
              Pittheus, and two daughters, Nicippe and Lysidice, who married Sthenelos and Mestôr
              the sons of Perseus.</p>
            <p>In this mythe also there is much obscurity. We will commence our examination of it by
              inquiring into the Lydian origin of Pelops, a thing taken for granted by all
              historians from Herodotus and Thucydides<note place="bottom">Herod. vii. 8. 11. Thue.
                i. 9.</note> down to our own days.</p>
            <p>Homer, when giving an account of Agamemnôn’s sceptre, says<note place="bottom">Il.
                ii. 103. 104.</note> that Zeus gave it to Hermes, by whom it was given to
              ‘horse-lashing’ Pelops, which signifies that Pelops was a prince rich in flocks and
              herds who ruled by a legitimate title. This certainly does not contradict the notion
              of his being a foreigner, but it does not confirm it ; and it seems very strange that
              Homer should never have alluded to the Asiatic origin of the Atreids if it was a
              matter of belief in his days. Hesiod<note place="bottom">Sch. Pind. Ol. i. 127.</note>
              probably related the winning of Hippodameia. In the Cypria it was said, that from the
              summit of Taÿgetos Lynceus looked over the ‘whole isle of Pelops Tantalides’<note
                place="bottom">See above, p. 431. <hi rend="i">note.</hi></note> ; which passage is
              the earliest intimation that we have of any connexion between Pelops and Tantalos, as
              it is the first mention of the Peloponnese. Pindar<note place="bottom">Ol. i.
                37.</note> calls Pelops a Lydian.</p>
            <p>The name Pelops’-isle or Peloponnese is, we think, decisive <pb n="446" xml:id="p446"
              />of the whole question. There was no such practice known in remote antiquity as that
              of calling a country or even a town after a person ; Pelops must be therefore either
              the personification of a people the Pelopians, or of some natural quality or property
              of the land. Some therefore derive Pelops from ἕλ<hi rend="i">α, splendour</hi>, and
              render it the <hi rend="i">Illustrious</hi>, an honorific appellation of prince or
                people<note place="bottom">Welcker in Schwenk. 336.</note>. Others connect it with
                <hi rend="i">πη</hi>λ<hi rend="i">ὸς, ἕ</hi>λ<hi rend="i">α</hi>, and the family of

                place="bottom">Völcker, Myth. der Jap. 351. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. This last
              theory is supported by the horsemanship of Pelops and the connexion between him and
              Poseidôn ; and possibly Pelops may be only another name of the water-god whom we find
              with so many names at the Isthmus. The origin of the name Peloponnese, which is
              certainly post-Homeric, still however is enveloped in obscurity ; for in those times
              lands were not called after gods any more than after men.</p>

              in order to renew it. Hermes the rural god restores Pelops to life, and the same
              Hermes, under the name of Myrtilos, that is Myrtos, or the protector of the myrtles
              that love the sea-shore, enables him to win the prize. The connexion between this god
              and Pelops is also intimated in the tradition that the first temple of Hermes in the
              Peloponnese was built by Pelops.</p>

              time, it is added, he pronounced a curse on them that they and their posterity should
              perish by means of one another. They retired to Mideia, whence on the death of Pelops

              disputed. Atreus, in order to prove that the kingdom by right was his, said he would
              produce a goldfleeced lamb : Thyestes, however, having corrupted Atreus’ wife Aërope,
              had gotten the lamb ; and when Atreus could not exhibit it as he promised, the people
              thinking he had deceived them deprived him of the kingdom. Sometime after however
              Atreus returned and said that to prove his right he would let them see the Sun and the
              Pleiades moving from west to east. This miracle Zeus performed in his favour, and he
              thus obtained the kingdom and drove Thyestes into exile<note place="bottom">Sch.

              and served their flesh up to their father ; and while Thyestes was eating he caused

              said, at the sight of this horrible deed checked his chariot in the midst of his

                Thyestes.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thyestes fled to Thesprotia, whence he went to Sicyôn, where his daughter Pelopia
              dwelt. He arrived on the very night in which she was to offer a sacrifice to Athena,
              and not wishing to disturb the ceremony, he hid himself in the grove. As Pelopia was
              joining in the sacred dance, she slipped in the blood of the victims and defiled her
              clothes. Quitting the dance, she went down to the river to wash the dirt from her
              garment. When she had taken it off, Thyestes, covering his head that he might not be
              known, sprang from his lurkingplace, and forcibly embraced her. In the struggle she
              drew his sword from the sheath, and taking it back with her, concealed it in the
              temple of Athena.</p>
            <p>The next day Thyestes presented himself to the king of Sicyôn, and besought him to
              restore him to his native country. Meantime famine and plague had come to punish the
              crime of Atreus ; and the oracle had responded, that to remove it Atreus should bring
              back his brother. He went to Thesprotia in search of him, where he beheld Pelopia the
              daughter of Thyestes ; and supposing her to be the daughter of the king, demanded her
              in marriage. Thesprotos gave her to him. She was already pregnant by her father, and
              shortly after her marriage brought forth a son, whom Atreus caused to be exposed ; but
              the herdsman, taking pity on him, reared him on the dugs of a she-goat (<hi rend="i"
                >αἰγὸς</hi>) — whence he derived his name, Ægisthos. Atreus, hearing he was alive,
              had him sought for, and brought him up as his own son.</p>
            <p>Atreus afterwards sent his sons Agamemnôn and Menelaos in search of Thyestes. They
              went to Delphi, where they met him, who was also come to consult the god on the nature
              of the vengeance which he should seek to take on his brother. They seized and brought
              him to Atreus, who cast him into prison. Atreus then called Ægisthos, and directed him
              to <pb n="449" xml:id="p449"/>put the captive to death. Ægisthos went to the prison,
              bearing the sword which his mother had given him ; and the moment Thyestes beheld it,
              he knew it to be that which he had lost, and asked the youth how he had come by it. He
              replied that it was the gift of his mother. At the desire of Thyestes, Pelopia came,
              and the whole deed of darkness was brought to light. The unfortunate daughter of
              Thyestes, under pretence of examining the sword, plunged it into her bosom. Ægisthos
              drew it forth reeking with blood, and brought it to Atreus as a proof of having obeyed
              his commands. Rejoiced at the death, as he thought, of his brother, Atreus offered a
              sacrifice of thanksgiving on the shore of the sea ; but while he was engaged in it, he
              was fallen on and slain by Thyestes and Ægisthos<note place="bottom">Hyginus, <hi

            <p>This is the most horrible legend in the Grecian mythology. It is evidently
              post-Homeric, for exclusive of the fact that such atrocities are quite repugnant to
              the spirit of the heroic ages as portrayed in the Homeric poems, it is utterly
              irreconcilable with the account of the Pelopids given in them. Of Agamemnôn’s sceptre
              it is said that Hephæstos made it and gave it to Zeus, who gave it to Hermes, by whom
              it was presented to ‘horse-lashing’ Pelops, who gave it to Atreus the shepherd of the
              people, who when dying left it to ‘lambabounding’ Thyestes, who left it to
                Agamemnôn<note place="bottom">Il. ii. 101. <hi rend="i">seq</hi></note>. Here we
              have a family of princes rich in cattle legitimately transmitting the sceptre from one
              to the other, a state of things totally at variance with the atrocities above related.
              It was probably at the time when the Greeks had become familiar with Asia and the
              barbarous regions round the Euxine that the nameless deeds of ‘Pelops’ line' were
              invented. The author of the Alcmæonis, whoever he was, is said to have related the
              story of the gold-fleeced lamb<note place="bottom">Sch. Eurip. Orest. 995.</note>. We
              know not who first told of the horrid banquet, but we find it frequently alluded to by
                Æschylus<note place="bottom">Agam. 1104, 1228. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> ; 1594. <hi

              the deeds of Atreus and Thyestes the subject of a drama. Sophocles wrote two Thyestes,
              and Euripides one ; and we have <pb n="450" xml:id="p450"/>probably their contents in
              the legends transmitted to us by Hyginus.</p>
            <p>There is a difficulty in the Homeric account of Agamemnôn’s being the successor of
              Thyestes, for he calls him more than once the son of Atreus<note place="bottom">Il.
                ii. 23 ; xi. 131.</note>, and in the Odyssey he is murdered by Ægisthos the son of

                correct, Homer may not have made Ægisthos the son of Thyestes.</note>. The common
              solution of Atreus having left his kingdom to his brother in charge for his son, who
              was not of age, is not, we believe, agreeable to the Homeric usage.</p>

            <p rend="noindent"><hi rend="sc">Artemis</hi> was worshiped at Patræ under the name of
              Triclaria. Her priestess was always a virgin, who held her office till she married.
              This priesthood was once filled by a beautiful virgin named Comætho. A youth named
              Melanippos, also distinguished for his beauty, conceived a violent passion for the
              fair priestess, which was participated in by its object, but the parents of both the
              lovers refused their consent to the union. Thus thwarted in their lawful wishes, the
              youth and maiden lost sight of prudence, and they polluted the sanctity of the temple
              by the unhallowed gratification of their passion. The goddess was offended ; disease
              and pestilence testified to the people her displeasure.</p>
            <p>Envoys were sent to consult the Pythian oracle, and the voice of the god fixed the
              guilt on Comætho and Melanippos, whom he ordered to be sacrificed to Artemis, and a
              youth and maiden of superior beauty to be offered annually as victims to the goddess.
              For many years this cruel rite remained in use, and the stream which flowed by the
              temple derived from it the name of <hi rend="i">Implacable</hi> (<hi rend="i"

              hopes of its ceasing, when a stranger should arrive in the country bearing with him an
              unknown deity.</p>
            <p>On the division of the spoils at Troy, Eurypylos the son of Euæmôn had gotten a
              coffer containing a statue of Dionysos, the work of Hephæstos, as was said, and given
              to Dardanos by Zeus. Cassandra, it was also said, had thrown this coffer in the way of
              the Greeks, knowing that it would prove injurious to whoever should find it. Eurypylos
              opening it saw the statue, and immediately lost his senses : his reason however did
              not entirely depart, and he had lucid intervals. In consequence of this calamity,
              instead of going home to Thessaly, he sailed to Cirrha, and consulted the oracle at
              Delphi <pb n="452" xml:id="p452"/>for relief of his disorder. He was directed to take
              up his abode, and dedicate the coffer, where he should find people sacrificing after a
              strange fashion. He re-embarked, and the wind carried him to Aroe on the coast of
              Achaia, where he saw a procession moving along the shore, leading a youth and maiden
              to be sacrificed on the altar of the Triclarian Artemis. He at once perceived the
              accomplishment of the oracle given to him ; the Achæans saw that theirs also was
              fulfilled, the human sacrifices ceased, the stranger was restored to his reason, the
              coffer of Dionysos was dedicated, and the river changed its appellation to that of <hi

            <p>In Patræ stood a temple of the Calydonian Dionysos, whose statue had been brought
              thither from Calydôn. The following legend was related respecting it. While Calydôn
              flourished, a man named Coresos was priest of Dionysos in that country. A maiden named
              Callirrhoe became the object of his love, but unhappily the fervour of his attachment
              only augmented the hatred and aversion of the maiden to her lover. When neither gifts
              nor entreaties could avail to win her love, the priest in despair turned him to his
              god, and besought him to avenge his sufferings. The god heard the prayer of the
              suppliant, and an insanity similar to intoxication fell on the Calydonians, of which
              many of them perished.</p>
            <p>In their distress, they had recourse to the oracle of Dodona, and they learned that
              their calamity was the infliction of Dionysos, and would not cease till Coresos had
              sacrificed Callirrhoe, or some one who was willing to die in her stead. It was
              resolved to obey the oracle. Callirrhoe could find no one possessed of sufficient
              affection for her to pay so high a penalty ; friends, kindred, parents, all shrunk
              back, and the unhappy maiden was forced to submit to her cruel fate. As a victim, she
              was crowned and led to the altar, where Coresos stood to perform the appointed
              sacrifice ; but at the sight of her, love overcame every other sentiment in the bosom
              of the priest, and he slew himself instead of the beautiful victim. This last <pb
                n="453" xml:id="p453"/>and decisive proof of true affection quite vanquished the
              hitherto relentless maiden ; her violent hate was converted into ardent love ; and
              filled with pity for her lover, and shame at her own ungrateful insensibility, she
              retired to a fountain near the port of Calydôn, and there cut her own throat and died.

            is that of Crete, an island remarkable for its estrangement from the rest of Greece
            during the historic period ; for though Cretan archers served all parties as
            mercenaries, the people of Crete took no share in the Persian, Peloponnesian, or other
            wars. The political insignificance of Crete in this period might lead one to doubt of
            the power and dominion of the Cretan monarch Minôs in the mythic period ; and perhaps
            the truth of that dominion was too readily adopted from the Athenian legends by
            Thucydides, the introduction to whose admirable work has had too much influence on the
            minds of some modern inquirers, who seem to forget that he had only the same sources of
            information respecting the mythic ages as we ourselves possess, and that the art of
            historic criticism was unknown in his time. The Cretan cycle is confined to the Minoïc
            family, at the head of which are placed Zeus and Europa.</p>

              ‘breathing saffron from his mouth’ as she was gathering flowers with her companions in
              a mead near the sea-shore. Europa, delighted with the tameness and beauty of the
              animal, caressed him, crowned him with flowers, and at length ventured to mount on his
              back. The disguised god immediately made off with his lovely burden, ran along the
              waves of the sea, and stopped not till he arrived at Crete, not far from Gortyna. Here

              Asteriôn, to prove his claim to it he asserted that he could obtain whatever he prayed
              for. Then sacrificing to Poseidôn, he besought him to send him a bull from the bottom
              of the sea, promising to sacrifice whatever should appear. Poseidôn sent the bull, and
              Minôs received the kingdom. He ruled, according to Homer<note place="bottom">Od. xix.
                178.</note> , for nine years at Cnossos, and was the <hi rend="i">intimate
                friend</hi> (<hi rend="i">ὀαριστὴς</hi>) of Zeus, who gave him wise laws and
              regulations for his people. Minôs was victorious in war, and extended his dominion
              over the isles of the Ægæan.</p>
            <p>Minôs had a brazen man named Talôs given to him by Hephæstos, or to Europa by Zeus,
              who compassed the isle thrice in each day to prevent the landing of enemies. His mode
              of destroying them was to make himself red-hot in the fire and then embrace them. When
              the Argo approached Crete, Medeia persuaded Talôs that she could make him immortal :
              he suffered her to pull out the pin in his heel, and let the <hi rend="i">ichôr</hi>
              run out from his only vein, and he thus died<note place="bottom">Apollod. i. 9. 26.

            <p>The bull which Poseidôn had sent out of the sea being of large size and of a
              brilliant white hue, appeared to Minôs too beautiful an animal to be slain, and he put
              him in his herd, and substituted an ordinary bull. Poseidôn offended at this act made
              the bull run wild, and inspired Pasiphae with a strange passion for him, but which she
              had no means of gratifying. Dædalos, the celebrated Athenian artist, being at that
              time in Crete, having fled from home for homicide, <pb n="457" xml:id="p457"
              />undertook to accomplish the wishes of the queen. He accordingly formed a hollow cow
              of wood, covered with the hide of a real cow, in which he inclosed Pasiphae, and
              placed it in the mead where the bull used to feed. All succeeded as was desired, and
              Pasiphae became the mother of Asterios, called the Minotaur, from his having the head
              of a bull joined to the body of a man. Minôs, in compliance with an oracle, made
              Dædalos build for him the Labyrinth, an edifice with numberless winding passages and
              turnings, from which egress was almost impossible for those who entered it. In this he
              placed the Minotaur, where he preyed on the victims given to him<note place="bottom"

            <p>Ariadne the daughter of Minôs, as has been related above, fell in love with Theseus
              when he came to Crete, and furnished him with the clew which enabled him to thread the
              mazes of the Labyrinth. She fled with him from her father ; but Theseus, says Homer,
              did not reap the fruits of her love ; for when they arrived at the isle of Dia or
              Naxos, Artemis slew her on the testimony of Dionysos<note place="bottom">Od. xi.

              as Ariadne was weeping, Aphrodite came and consoled her by an assurance that she
              should be the bride of Dionysos. The god appeared, enjoyed her love, and gave her a

            <p>Ariadne (<hi rend="i">Much-pleasing</hi>) evidently belongs to the mythology of
              Dionysos, with whom she was associated in the Naxian worship. The Athenians, always
              anxious to enlarge their own narrow cycle at the expense of others, seem to have
              joined her with their Theseus, and it was thus perhaps that she became the daughter of
              Minôs. The passage in the Odyssey would be decisive on this point, were it not that
              the Athenians were such tamperers with the works of the old poets that one cannot help
              being suspicious of all passages relating to them. The passage of the Ilias in which
              Ariadne is mentioned is, we think, justly regarded as a late addition<note

            <p>Glaucos the son of Minôs pursuing, when a child, a mouse, fell into a jar of honey,
              and was smothered. When he could not be found, his father sent to inquire of the
              oracle about him. The answer he got was, that there was a three-coloured cow in his
              herd, and that he who could best tell what she was like could restore his son to life.
              The soothsayers were all assembled ; and Polyeidos the son of Coiranos said, her
              colour was that of the berry of the briar, — green, red, and lastly black. Minôs
              desired him to find his son ; and Polyeidos, by his skill in divination, discovered
              where he was. Minôs then ordered him to restore him to life ; and on his declaring his
              incapacity so to do, shut him up in a chamber with the body of the child. While here,
              the soothsayer saw a serpent approach the body, and he struck and killed it. Another
              immediately appeared with a plant in its mouth, and laid it on the dead one, who
              instantly came to life. Polyeidos, by employing the same herb, recovered the
                child<note place="bottom">See above, p. 423.</note>.</p>

            <p>On taking a survey of the circumstances of these Cretan legends, and the names of the
              persons who occur in them, it is difficult to avoid recognising a worship of the
              celestial bodies, more particularly of the Moon, of which last the names of the Minoïc
              family would appear to have been appellations. Thus Europa (<hi rend="i"
                >Broad-face</hi>) is the daughter of Phœnix (<hi rend="i">Red</hi>) and Telephassa
                (<hi rend="i">Far-shining</hi>), and mother of Minôs, a name not unlike <hi rend="i"
                >Men</hi><note place="bottom">Menoo is the name of the Hindoo legislator : Menes was
                the first mortal king of Egypt : Manes was the first king of Lydia : Minyas one of
                the earliest kings of Greece : Minos the first king and lawgiver of Crete. To these
                Buttmann (Mythol. ii. 232. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi>) joins the German Mannus, <hi
                  rend="i">Man</hi> ; and supposing this last to be the true meaning of all these
                names, infers, in his usual manner, the original unity of all these peoples and
                their traditions.</note> (Μ<hi rend="i">ὴν, Moon</hi>) ; and she marries Asteriôn
                (<hi rend="i">Starry</hi>). The wife of Minôs is Pasiphae (<hi rend="i"
                >All-bright</hi>), the daughter of the Sun and Perseïs ; and their daughter is
              Phædra (<hi rend="i">Bright</hi>). Though we do not believe that the mystic mode of
              viewing the sun as a bull and the moon as a cow prevailed in early Greece, the horns
              of the latter gave occasion to the idea of her riding or driving steers ; and perhaps
              the legend of Europa passing over the sea on a bull is an ancient expression of this
              idea. The same may have been the origin of the tale of Pasiphae's love for the bull,
              and of her offspring by him, the Moon-bull, as Minotaur may best perhaps be rendered.
              The circumstances of the legends are mostly the inventions of the Athenians, at the
              hands of whose dramatists the characters of the Minoïc family suffered severely.</p>
            <p>Though we thus see in the Cretan cycle only personifications of the moon, Minôs and
              his family may have been real persons named after their favourite deity. We regard
              this hypothesis however as being by no means probable. The connexion of Minôs with
              Poseidôn, the naval power ascribed to him, and the names Glaucos and Deucaliôn among
              his <pb n="460" xml:id="p460"/>children, might seem to indicate a Cretan worship of
              the god of the sea.</p>

              Kedaliôn (<hi rend="i">Guardian</hi>), one of his men, to be his guide to the abode of
              the Sun. Placing Kedaliôn on his shoulder, Oriôn proceeded to the East ; and there
              meeting the Sun-god, was restored to vision by his beam. Anxious for vengeance on
              Œnopiôn, he returned to Chios ; but the Chians, aware of his intention, concealed the
              object of his search under the ground, and Oriôn unable to find him retired to
                Crete<note place="bottom">Hesiod <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi> Apollod. <hi rend="i">ut

            <p>The death of Oriôn is differently related. As all the legends respecting him are
              evidently later than the time of Homer, none ventures to assign any other cause to it
              than the goddess Artemis, whose wrath (though Homer rather says the contrary) he drew
              on himself. Some said that he attempted to offer violence to the goddess herself ;
              others, to Opis, one of her Hyperborean maidens, and that Artemis slew him with her
              arrows ; others again, that it was for presuming to challenge the goddess at the
              discus. It was also said, that when he came to Crete, he boasted to Leto and Artemis
              that he was able to kill anything that would come from the earth. Indignant at his
              boast they sent a huge scorpion, which stung him, and he died. It was said, finally,
              that Artemis loved Oriôn, and was even about to marry him. Her brother was highly
              displeased, and often chid her, but to no purpose. At length, observing one day Oriôn
              wading through the sea with his head just above the waters, he pointed it out to his
              sister, and maintained that she could not hit that black thing on the sea. The
              archer-goddess discharged a shaft : the waves rolled the dead body of Oriôn to the
              land ; and bewailing her fatal error with many tears, Artemis placed him among the
                stars<note place="bottom">Hesiod, Euphoriôn and others, <hi rend="i">ut

            <p>The Pleiades were said to be seven in number, the daughters of Atlas and the Oceanis
              Pleione. Their names were Maia, Electra, Taÿgete (the mothers by Zeus of Hermes,
              Dardanos and Lacedæmôn), Halcyone and Celæno (who bore to Poseidôn Hyrieus the father
              of Oriôn and Lycos), Sterope (the mother of Œnomaos by Ares), and Merope, who married
                Sisyphos<note place="bottom">Sch. II. xviii. 486. Apollod. iii. 1. Hygin. P. A. ii.

            <p>These nymphs led a single life, and hunted with Artemis. Oriôn happening to see them
              became enamoured, and pursued them ; in their distress they prayed to the gods to
              change their form, and Zeus in pity turned them to pigeons, and then made them a

              all doubt they were thus named long before they were converted into a hunter and
              nymphs on the earth. It has been clearly shown that it was the union of astronomy with
              mythology in the Alexandrian period that gave occasion to the <hi rend="i"

              the case seems to have been reversed, the constellations having been brought down from
              the sky, and not the mortals raised to it.</p>
            <p>Man loves to trace in natural objects resemblances to other objects with which he is
              familiar. Hence many legends of rocks, mountains, and such like. The sky too offers
              its similitudes ; there is, for example, the Crown, with its legend of Ariadne ; there
              is the ‘Man in the Moon,’ which some said was Cain, others the man who was stoned for
              gathering sticks on the Sabbath. The resemblance of the ‘Wain’ (<hi rend="i"
                >ἃμαξα</hi>) to a rude carriage is obvious enough, and the similitude seems to have
              struck both Greeks and Scandinavians<note place="bottom">Its ancient name in the North
                is <hi rend="i">Karlsvagn</hi>, the ‘Carle' s or Oldman’s Wain.’ The Carle, Magnusen

              likeness to an animal is not so obvious, yet the Greeks and the North American Indians
              agree in naming it the ‘Bear,’ and the Foollahs of Africa call it the ‘Elephant<note
                place="bottom">Mollien, Travels in Africa, p. 297.</note>’, while the husbandmen in

              ‘Clucking Hen’ (<hi rend="i">Gluckhenne</hi>).</p>
            <p>These last similitudes lead us to think that the original conception of the Pleiades
              was the ‘Pigeons’ (π<hi rend="i">ϵλϵιάδϵς</hi>)<note place="bottom">The prevalent
                derivation of their name from <hi rend="i">πλέω to sail</hi>, though apparently so

                xml:id="p466"/>are sometimes named, and with which supposition the legends told of
              them will accord. Their clustering together (whence they were also named the

                  supra.</hi></note>) might easily have suggested the idea. In like manner we think
              it probable that the true signification of the Hyades lies in their Latin name <hi
                rend="i">Suculæ</hi>, or ‘Little Pigs,’ given them for a similar reason<note
                place="bottom">See Appendix (M.), and Nitzsch on Od. v. 269-275.</note>. The Latin
              name of the Pleiades was <hi rend="i">Vergiliæ</hi>, or rather perhaps <hi rend="i"
                >Virgiliæ</hi>, i. e. the ‘Bunch-stars,’ like the Greek name<note place="bottom"
                >Nitzsch <hi rend="i">ut supra.</hi></note>. Oriôn was named by the Latins <hi
                rend="i">Jugula</hi><note place="bottom">Varro, L. L. vi. p. 91.</note>, or the
              ‘Warrior,’ and his Greek name probably signifies the <hi rend="i">Rouser</hi> or <hi
                rend="i">Exciter</hi> (ΟΡΩ, <hi rend="i">ὀρίνω</hi>), in allusion to his hunting, or
              to the storms which he raised<note place="bottom">The Latins termed Oriôn <hi rend="i"
                  >nimbosus, procellosus, aquosus, turbidus, niger, vehemens.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>To the Grecian herdsman or hunter therefore at particular seasons of the year the
              nocturnal sky would have presented the following appearance. The broad brilliant
              constellation Oriôn with Sirius behind him would be a hunter and his dog, before whom
              the Pigeons were flying, while the Bear, the object of his pursuit, kept watching him.
              Thus there would be a chase in the sky similar to those on earth, and legends would
              naturally arise which would be localised and expanded in the usual manner.</p>
            <p>For as the stars rise out of the sea, as it were, nothing was more obvious than to
              make Oriôn the son of Poseidôn and Euryale (<hi rend="i">Wide-sea</hi>) ; then again,
              as the dawn, as it were, takes away the stars, Oriôn is carried off by Eôs ; and as
              the mild effulgence of the moon dims and effaces the light of the stars, so Oriôn is
              slain by the gentle darts of ‘holy’ Artemis. The beauty and size of the constellation
              caused the hero to be represented as the largest and handsomest of mortals. Their
              relative positions in the sky gave occasion to the mythe of his love and pursuit of
              the Pleiades ; and the proximity between the signs Oriôn and the Scorpion led to the
              Alexandrian fiction of the mode of the hero' s death.</p>
            <p>The story of Oriôn and Œnopiôn is perhaps explicable on <pb n="467" xml:id="p467"
              />the same principle. The constellation which rises in July loves with an ardent
              passion the daughter of the vine. When the grapes are gathered and pressed, they are,
              as it were, taken out of his sight, or he is made drunk with new wine and blinded. His
              journey to the East denotes the heliacal rising of the star ; and when he comes back
              the vine is hidden from his power within the ground<note place="bottom">See Völcker,
                Myth. der Jap. 112. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>It is probable that many of the individual names of the Pleiades and Hyades are those
              of nymphs who were previously placed in other relations. Thus Maia is in the Hymn to
              Hermes merely an Arcadian nymph. Taÿgete refers to Mount Taÿgeton, and Merope (<hi
                rend="i">Mortal</hi>) is simply the nymph united to the <hi rend="i">mortal.</hi>
              Electra and Sterope refer to <hi rend="i">brightness</hi> ; and Haleyone and Celæno,
              whom the legend unites to Poseidôn, are plainly related to the sea. Among the Hyades
              we find Dione, the ancient goddess of Dodona ; Ambrosia, Coronis, Eudora are names
              evidently given from their nourishing nature as nymphs<note place="bottom">Coronis,

              set a piece of timber, cut from the speaking-oak of Dodona. When the ship was

            <p>The call was readily responded to, and numerous sons of gods hastened to embark in

              from Thessaly, and Orpheus, the son of the Muse Calliope. The steersman was Tiphys son
              of Agnios, from Siphæ in Bœotia. The entire number was fifty<note place="bottom"

            <p>When the heroes were all assembled, Mopsos took auguries, and the signs being
              favourable, they got on board ; Iasôn standing at the poop poured a libation from a
              golden cup, and called on Zeus, the Winds, the Sea, the Days, the Nights, and the Fate
              presiding over their return. Thunder then rolled in the clouds, propitious lightnings

              with his voice, their oars kept time to the harmony. The gods looked down from the
              sky, the nymphs of Pelion gazed in wonder at this first of ships, and Cheirôn leaving
              his mountain-cave cheered them, and prayed for their happy return<note place="bottom"
                >Pind. Pyth. iv.</note>.</p>
            <p>At the close of day they had reached the mouth of the bay of Pagasæ. Here they
              remained for two days, and then rowed along the coast of Magnesia, and, passing the
              peninsula of Pallene, at length reached the isle of Lemnos, in which there were at
              that time no men, and Hypsipyle the daughter of Thoas governed it as queen. For the
              Lemnian women having, it was said, offended Aphrodite, she caused them to have an ill
              smell ; so that their husbands, unable to endure them, took to their beds the captives
              whom they had brought from Thrace. The Lemnian wives, incensed at this neglect,
              murdered their husbands. Hypsipyle alone saved her father, whom she kept concealed.
              This event had occurred about a twelvemonth before. The women seeing the Argonauts
              took them for their enemies the Thracians, and came down in arms to oppose their
              landing ; but on ascertaining who they were they retired and held a council, in which,
              on the advice of Hypsipyle's nurse, it was decided that they should invite them to
              land, and take this occasion of having children. The Argonauts readily accepted the
              invitation, Heracles alone refusing to quit the vessel. They gave themselves up to joy
              and festivity, till on the remonstrances of that hero they tore themselves from the
              Lemnian fair ones, and once more handled their oars.</p>
            <p>They then came to Samothrace, and thence pursued their voyage through the Hellespont
              into the Propontis, where they came to an island with a lofty hill in it named the
              Bears’ Hill, inhabited by giants with six arms. The adjacent country was possessed by
              the Dolionians, whose king was named Cyzicos. Having been hospitably entertained by
              this prince, and having slain the giants who opposed their departure, they set sail,
              but were driven back by adverse winds. It was in the night that they returned, and the
              Dolionians taking them to be their enemies, the Pelasgians, attacked them ; and
              several of the <pb n="470" xml:id="p470"/>Dolionians, and among them Cyzicos, lost
              their lives. With day-light discerning the error, the Argonauts shore their hair, and
              shedding many tears buried Cyzicos with solemn magnificence.</p>
            <p>They then sailed to Mysia, where they left behind them Heracles and Polyphemos ; for
              Hylas, a youth beloved by the former, having gone for water, was laid hold on and kept
              by the nymphs of the spring into which he dipped his urn. Polyphemos, hearing him
              call, went with his drawn sword to aid him, supposing him to have fallen into the
              hands of robbers. Meeting Heracles, he told him what had happened ; and both proceeded
              in quest of the youth. Meantime the Argo put to sea, and left them behind. Polyphemos
              settled in Mysia, and built the town of Kios : Heracles returned to Argos<note
                place="bottom">According to Theocritus (Idyll. xiii.), the hero proceeded on foot to
                Colchis. In the poem named ‘The Wedding of Ceÿx,’ Heracles is said to have been left
                behind at Aphetæ, where he went for water (Sch. Apoll. Rh. i. 1290.). It was an
                ancient custom of the Bithynians, we may observe, to lament in the burning days of
                midsummer, and call out of the well, into which they fabled he had fallen, a god
                named Hylas. The Maryandinians lamented and sought Bormos, the Phrygians Lityorses,
                with dirges, in a similar manner. This usage of the Bithynians was adopted into
                their mythology by the Greek inhabitants of Kios, and connected in the manner above
                narrated with the Argonautic Expedition and the history of Heracles. See Müller,
                Orchom. 293. Dor. i. 367. 457. Proleg. 108.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Argo next touched at Bebrycia, where Amycos the son of Poseidôn and Bithynis
              reigned. Every stranger who arrived in this country was forced by Amycos to engage him
              at the cestus. He therefore challenged the Argonauts ; and Polydeukes engaged and
              killed him. The Bebrycians, seeing the fate of their prince, fell on the victor ; but
              his companions coming to his aid, they were repelled with great loss<note

            <p>Leaving Bebrycia, they sailed to Salmydessos on the Thracian coast, where Phineus,
              the prophet-prince, dwelt in blindness and misery. He was the son of Agenôr (or of
              Poseidôn), and was married to Cleopatra the daughter of Boreas and Oreithyia. She
              died, leaving him two sons ; and he then married Idæa the daughter of Dardanos.
              Jealous of her stepchildren, Idæa maligned them to their father, who, believing the
              slander, deprived them of sight. The gods, to punish <pb n="471" xml:id="p471"/>him,
              struck him blind, and sent the Harpies to torment him : these fell monsters came
              flying the instant food was set before him, carried off the greater portion of it, and
              so defiled what they left that no mortal could endure to eat it<note place="bottom"
                >Others said he was thus punished for having revealed the will of Zeus to men

              Phineus about their future course, he promised to direct them on condition of their
              delivering him from the Harpies. This they undertook to do. The table was spread : the
              Harpies instantly descended screaming, and seized the victuals. Zetes and Calaïs the
              winged sons of Boreas then drew their swords and pursued them through the air<note
                place="bottom">It is plain that the Harpies in this legend, as in the Theogony, are
                but two in number. Virgil seems to make a flock of them.</note>. The Harpies flew
              along the Propontis, over the Ægæan and Greece to some islets beyond the Peloponnese,
              where their pursuers came up with them, and were about to slay them, when Iris
              appearing forbade the deed, and the Harpies were dismissed on their oath never more to
              molest Phineus. The isles were thenceforth named the Strophodes, because the Boreiads
              there <hi rend="i">turned</hi> back<note place="bottom">Apoll. Rh. ii. 281. <hi
                  rend="i">seq.</hi> Apollodorus relates the conclusion of the chase somewhat
                differently.</note>.</p>
            <p>Freed from his tormentors, Phineus now instructs his deliverers in the nature of
              their future voyage. The Symplegades were the first danger which they had to
              encounter. These were huge floating rocks, which were at times driven together by the
              winds, and crushed whatever came between them. Mist enveloped them, and loud was the
              crash when they met. Even to the birds the passage was then impossible. Phineus
              directed the heroes to let fly a pigeon, saying if she came safely through, the Argo
              might venture to follow her. They obeyed the directions of the prophet ; the pigeon
              passed through safely with the loss of her tail ; watching then the recession of the
              rocks, and aided by Hera and Athena, they rowed the Argo vigorously on, and escaped so
              narrowly, that the rocks as they rushed together carried off some of her stern-works.
              The Symplegades now became fixed ; for so it <pb n="472" xml:id="p472"/>was in the
              fates, since a ship had passed through them uninjured.</p>
            <p>Having escaped the Symplegades, they came to the country of the Mariandynians, whose
              king Lycos received them kindly. Here died Idmôn the seer, wounded by the tusks of a
              wild boar. Tiphys also dying here, Ancæos undertook the steerage of the vessel.</p>
            <p>They now kept along the southern coast of the Pontos till they came to the isle of
              Aretias, which was haunted by birds that shot feathers sharp as arrows from their
              wings. These they drove off by clattering on their shields ; and while they remained
              in the isle, the sons of Phrixos, who were on their way to Greece, were cast on it by
              a storm, and they became their guides to Colchis, where they shortly after entered the
              Phasis. Iasôn lost no time in informing king Æetes of the cause of his coming, and in
              requesting him to give him the Golden Fleece. The king assented, provided he could
              yoke the brassfooted bulls. These were the gifts of Hephæstos to Æetes, in number two,
              and breathing flame from their throats. When he had yoked these, he was to plough with
              them a piece of land, and sow the serpent’s teeth which Æetes possessed, for Athena
              had given him one half of those which Cadmos sowed at Thebes.</p>
            <p>Iasôn was in perplexity about the accomplishment of these hard tasks, when Medeia,
              the daughter of the king, who had conceived a sudden affection for him, proffered her
              aid, if he would swear to marry her, and take her with him to Greece. Such aid was not
              to be rejected : the hero swore : Medeia, who was an enchantress, gave him a salve to
              rub his body, shield, and spear. The virtue of this salve would last an entire day,
              and protect alike against fire and steel. She further told him, that when he had sown
              the teeth, a crop of armed men would spring up and prepare to attack him. Among these
              she desired him to fling stones, and while they were fighting with one another about
              them, to fall on and slay them. The hero followed the advice of the princess : he
              entered the sacred grove of Ares, yoked the bulls, ploughed the land, and slaughtered
              the armed crop which it produced.</p>
            <pb n="473" xml:id="p473"/><p>But Æetes refused to give the Fleece, and meditated to
              burn the Argo and slay her crew. Medeia, anticipating him, led Iason by night to the
              Golden Fleece : with her drugs she cast to sleep the serpent which guarded it ; and
              then taking her little brother Apsyrtos out of his bed she embarked with him in the
              Argo, and the vessel set sail while it was yet night<note place="bottom">Pherecydes

            <p>Æetes, on discovering the treachery and flight of his daughter, got on shipboard and
              pursued the fugitives. Medeia seeing him gaining on them <hi rend="i">cut</hi> her

              then dispatched a number of his subjects in pursuit of the Argo, threatening if they
              did not bring back his daughter to inflict on them the punishment designed for
              her.</p>
            <p>At length, by a route which we shall presently trace, the Argo entered the West Sea
              and came to Ææa, the isle of Circe. The goddess performed the usual rites of
              purification to remove the blood-guilt of the death of Apsyrtos. The heroes then
              departed. Ere long they came to the isle of the Sirens, charmed by whose entrancing
              strains they were about to land on that fatal shore, when Orpheus struck his lyre, and
              with its tones overpowered their voices. Wind and wave urged on the Argo, and all
              escaped but Butes, who flung himself into the sea to swim to the Flowery Isle.
              Aphrodite to save him took him and set him to dwell at Lilybæon. The Argonauts now
              passed Scylla and Charybdis, and also the Wandering Rocks ; over these they beheld
              flame and smoke ascending, but Thetis and her sister Nereïdes guided them through by
              the command of Hera. Passing Thrinakia, the isle of the Sun, they came to the island
              of the Phæacians. Some of the Colchians who were in pursuit of the Argonauts arriving
              there, seized on the Argo, and requested Alcinoös to give Medeia up to them. He
              assented, provided she was yet a maid. His wife Arete hearing this, lost no time in
              joining the lovers in wedlock ; and the Colchians then fearing to return, settled in
                <pb n="474" xml:id="p474"/>the island. Sailing thence, the Argo was assailed by a
              tremendous storm which drove it to the Syrtes on the coast of Libya. After being
              detained there for some time they proceeded on their homeward voyage and came to
              Crete, where the brazen man, Talôs, prohibited their landing ; but Medeia by her art
              deprived him of life. On leaving Crete the night came on so black and dark that they
              knew not where they were ; but Apollo, taking his stand on the rocks called the
              Melantian Neeks, shot an arrow into the sea : the arrow flashed a vivid light, and
              they beheld an island, on which they landed. As this isle had <hi rend="i"
                >appeared</hi> (<hi rend="i">ἀνϵϕῄνατο</hi>) so unexpectedly, they named it
                Anaphe<note place="bottom">Anaphe was one of the Sporades. It and the Melantian
                Necks were near Thera.</note>. Here they erected an altar to Apollo Ægletes (<hi
                rend="i">Lightner</hi>), and offered sacrifices ; they thence proceded to Ægina,
              where they watered ; and they finally arrived at Iolcos after an absence of four
              months.</p>
            <p>When Pelias in Pindar<note place="bottom">Pyth. iv. 283. <hi rend="i"
                >seq.</hi></note> is urging Iasôn to this celebrated adventure, he says that a dream
              and the response of the Delphic oracle had directed him to go to Ææa and fetch back
              the soul of Phrixos and the ‘thick-wooled’ skin of the ram which had saved him. From
              various circumstances it seems clear that the Argonautics were mysteriously connected
              with the worship of the Laphystian Zeus<note place="bottom">Above, p. 334.</note>;
              that they belonged to the Minyans and to them alone ; that Heracles, Theseus, and the
              other heroes who did not belong to this people were added to the cycle in the progress
              of time by the poets and by the vanity of those whose patron-heroes they were. It may
              also have been that the commercial voyages of the Minyans were united with the mythic
              expedition. If the gold-mines of Thasos or Pangæos were wrought so early, their
              produce may have given its <hi rend="i">golden</hi> hue to the fleece. This however is
              no essential part of the mythe, as it is also said to be <hi rend="i">white</hi> or

            <p>There can be little doubt that the direction of this mythic voyage was north-east,
              for Lemnos and Samothrace occur in <pb n="475" xml:id="p475"/>all accounts of it.
              Where it originally terminated cannot be said with certainty ; for its limit advanced
              with the progress of nautical enterprise and colonisation. At Lampsacos, Cyzicos,
              Kios, Byzantion, and other places along the Hellespont, Propontis and Bosporos, we
              meet with Argonautic traditions. When it entered the Pontos the mythe took two
              different directions, just as the colonies themselves did, the one northwards to the
              Tauric Chersonese or Scythia, and this was probably the earlier one, as this was the
              first direction of the Grecian colonies ; the other along the southern coast, and
              finally reaching the Phasis and Colchis, which last place is first named by the
              Corinthian poet Eumelos, who did not flourish till after Ol. 20. This became the
              prevalent opinion, and the establishment of Heracleia and other Grecian colonies on
              this coast enlarged the cycle with traditions of the country, or with fictions of the
              inhabitants of the colonies<note place="bottom">There is nowhere so much information
                on the Argonautics to be found as in Müller's Orchomenos, to which we refer our
                readers.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the ancient ante-Homeric Argonautics it is probable that the adventurers returned
              by the road they went ; but the poet of the Odyssey (if our hypothesis respecting him
              be correct), in order to augment the marvels of the sea, which he made the scene of
              his hero's wanderings, transferred thither the abode of Æetes and the Wandering Rocks
              through which he makes the Argo pass on her return with the same danger as she
              encounters in the Argonautics on her outward voyage. The fame of the Odyssey soon made
              it an established article of belief that the Argonauts returned home through the
              Mediterranean, and, as we have seen, they were made to pursue the same route in it
              with Odysseus. The only question was how to bring them thither from Colchis.</p>
            <p>The first course was that taken by Hesiod, who was followed by Pindar, Hecatæus and
                Antimachus<note place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. iv. 259. 284. Pind. Pyth. iv. 44. <hi
                  rend="i">seq.</hi></note>. This was to make them go up the Phasis, which in
              accordance with the early geographical ideas was held to flow out of the Ocean, which
              they then entered and proceeded along it southwards. Hecatæus made them then sail down
              the Nile and so home, but according to the others they landed on the south coast of
                <pb n="476" xml:id="p476"/>Libya, and carrying the Argo on their shoulders across
              it, (for twelve days, says Pindar) launched it on lake Tritonis and thus entered the
              Mediterranean. It being afterwards proved by Artemidorus and Eratosthenes that the
              Phasis had its source in the mountains, this course had to be given up ; a geographer
              named Timagetas then fixed on the Ister, for he supposed this river to flow out of a
              great lake in the Celtic mountains, from the opposite end of which another stream
              flowed into the Tyrrhenian sea ; he was followed by Apollonius and by another poet
              named Peisander<note place="bottom">Sch. Apoll. Rh. <hi rend="i">ut sup.</hi></note>.
              The geographer Scymnus however showed that this could not be, as the Ister flowed
              directly from the Alps, and he maintained that they must have gone up the Tanaïs ; in
              this however he had been preceded by the historian Timæus<note place="bottom"><hi
                  rend="i">Id. ib</hi></note>. According to their view, the Argonauts went up the
              Tanaïs to its head, they then carried their vessel overland to the northern ocean,
              where they launched it, and so sailed down the west side of Europe to the
              Mediterranean ; the only poet who adopted this view is the pseudo-Orpheus, who assigns
              them the following course.</p>
            <p>They sailed up the Phasis to the point where it divided, and then went down the other
              branch named the Saranges into the Mæotis, whence another stream ran northwards with
              great velocity. They entered this and were whirled along for nine days, on the tenth
              they were carried through the gorges of the Rhipæan mountains, and the Argo rushed
              through the narrow stream and came into the Ocean, called in that part by the
              Hyperboreans ‘the Cronian Main and Dead Sea.’ Having rowed for some time through its
              sluggish waters, they disembarked, and dragging their vessel along came on the sixth
              day to the country of the Long-lived (<hi rend="i">Macrobii</hi>), to whom the poet
              gives all the qualities and all the felicity of Hesiod’s Golden Men. They then reached
              the land of the Kimmerians, which lay on the same coast ; and having passed by the
              isle Iernis (<hi rend="i">Ireland</hi> ?), on the twelfth morn the sharp-sighted
              Lynceus descried on the verge of Ocean ‘the piny isle, in which is the extensive abode
              of queen Demeter,’ as it lay enveloped in mist. Orpheus having warned him of the
              danger of approaching it, Ancæos steered for the isle of Circe, which <pb n="477"
                xml:id="p477"/>they reached on the third day. Leaving it, they entered the strait of
              Tartessus, and passing the Pillars of Heracles arrived in the Mediterranean.</p>
            <p>The literature of this cycle is as follows. Iasôn and the Argo are noticed by
                Homer<note place="bottom">Il. vii. 469 ; xxi. 41. Od. xii. 69.</note> ; Hesiod

              it ; it is narrated in detail by Apollodorus and by Diodorus. Ovid also relates a a
              good part of it, and there is an unfinished poem on it by the Latin poet Valerius
              Flaccus, which displays genius and originality. There is also the Argonautics of the
              pseudo-Orpheus, a poem to which the ablest critics on different grounds assign a date
              long posterior to the commencement of the Christian æra. To these are to be added the
              detached notices in other writers and in the various Scholia. Of the dramas on this
              subject not a single one has been preserved<note place="bottom">Unless we except the

            <p>When Œdipûs, on the discovery of his involuntary crime, had either died or abandoned
              his throne, his sons Eteocles and Polyneices agreed to reign on alternate years.
              According to some, Polyneices governed for the first year, and then resigned his
              throne to his brother ; others say that Eteocles was the first occupant of the royal
              seat : all are agreed that when his year was expired he refused to make way for his
              brother. Polyneices taking with him the collar and robe of Harmonia fled to Argos,
              where Adrastos the son of Talaos son of Bias then reigned. It was night when the
              Theban exile arrived at the house of the king : before the door he met another
              stranger, Tydeus the son of Œneus, also a fugitive : a quarrel arose between them : at
              the clamour Adrastos came forth and put an end to the conflict. An oracle had told
              this prince that he should marry his two daughters to a lion and a bear, and he now
              saw its accomplishment, for such were the ornaments on the shields of the strangers.
              He gave Deïpyla to <pb n="478" xml:id="p478"/>Tydeus, and Argeia to the Theban prince,
              engaging to restore each to his country. The expedition against Thebes was the first
              resolved on, and each valiant warrior was invited to share in it.</p>
            <p>Amphiaraos the son of Oïcles was a soothsayer, and he knew by his art that it was
              fated that Adrastos alone should survive the war : he therefore declined taking part
              in the expedition, and warned the others against it. Polyneices was advised to
              endeavour to gain Eriphyle, the sister of Adrastos and wife of Amphiaraos, to his
              interest ; for on his marriage Amphiaraos had agreed, that whenever he and Adrastos
              should differ in opinion, the decision should be left to Eriphyle. Polyneices
              therefore gave her the collar of Harmonia, and the prophet was reluctantly forced to
              share in the war. He departed with evil forebodings, charging his sons to avenge his
              fate on their mother<note place="bottom">See Od. xi. 326 ; xv. 244. <hi rend="i"

            <p>The leaders were seven : Adrastos, Amphiaraos, Capaneus, Hippomedôn, — Argives ;
              Parthenopæos, an Arcadian ; Polyneices, a Theban ; Tydeus, an Ætolian<note

            <p>The host marched to Nemea, where Lycurgos then reigned. Being in want of water,
              Hypsipyle, the Lemnian princess, whom her country-women had sold when they found that
              she had saved her father, and who was now nurse to the infant child of Lycurgos,
              undertook to guide them to a spring. She left the child Opheltes lying on the grass,
              where a serpent found and killed him. The leaders slew the serpent, and buried the
              child. Amphiaraos augured ill-luck from this event, and called the child
                Archemoros<note place="bottom">Opheltes (from <hi rend="i">ὄϕιѕ</hi>) as he died by

                of the evils which were to befall the chiefs.</note>. They then celebrated funeral
              games in his honour. Adrastos gained the prize in the horse-race, Eteocles in the
              foot-race, Tydeus in the cestus, Amphiaraos in jumping and throwing the discus,
              Laodocos in casting the javelin, Polyneices in wrestling, Parthenopæos in archery.</p>
            <p>When they came to the banks of the Asopos near Cithærôn, they despatched Tydeus to
              Thebes, to claim a restitution of <pb n="479" xml:id="p479"/>the rights of Polyneices.
              He arrived as the Cadmeians were feasting in the halls of Eteocles ; and, after
              delivering his embassy, challenged them to a trial of skill and strength, and easily
              vanquished every one who contended with him. They laid an ambush of fifty men for him
              on his return, all of whom except Mæôn, one of their leaders, he slew<note

            <p>The Argive host appeared before the walls of Thebes. Each chief chose one of its
              seven gates to attack ; Adrastos, the Homoloïan ; Capaneus, the Ogygian ; Amphiaraos,
              the Prœtian ; Hippomedôn, the Oncaïan ; Polyneices, the Hypsistian ; Parthenopæos, the
              Electrian ; Tydeus, the Crenian. Eteocles set chiefs equal in number over the Thebans,
              and prepared vigorously for defence. He consulted Teiresias, who declared that victory
              would fall to Thebes, if Menœceus the son of Creôn gave himself a voluntary victim ;
              and that heroic youth learning the response, slew himself at the gates of the
              city.</p>
            <p>The fight began : the Cadmeians were driven into the city : Capaneus set a ladder
              against the wall, and was ascending, when Zeus offended at his impious language struck
              him with a thunderbolt<note place="bottom">Capaneus, from <hi rend="i">καπνὸѕ,
                  smoke.</hi></note>. The Argives fell back, and many were slain. Both hosts now
              resolved that the brothers should decide their quarrel in single combat. They fought,
              and fell by each other's hands. The battle was then rekindled with fury, and the four
              sons of Astacos greatly distinguished themselves, Ismaros killing Hippomedôn, Leades
              Eteocles, Amphidicos Parthenopæos, and Melanippos wounding Tydeus mortally. As he lay
              expiring, Athena hastened to him with a medicine which she had obtained from Zeus, and
              which would make him immortal<note place="bottom">Bacchylides <hi rend="i">ap.</hi>
                Sch. Aristoph. Birds, 1536.</note> ; but Amphiaraos, who hated him as a chief cause
              of the war, perceiving what the goddess was about, cut off the head of Melanippos,
              whom Tydeus though wounded had slain, and brought it to him. The savage warrior opened
              it, and devoured the brain, and Athena in disgust withheld her aid<note place="bottom"
                >Eur. Fr. Meleag. 18.</note>. Amphiaraos himself fled from the spear of
              Periclymenos, along the Ismenos. A thunderbolt launched by Zeus opened the ground, and
              he, his chariot, and his charioteer <pb n="480" xml:id="p480"/>Bato, were swallowed

            <p>Creôn, now king of Thebes, forbade the bodies of the Argives to be buried. Regardless
              of the menaced penalties, Antigone gave sepulture to the body of her brother
              Polyneices, and was by Creôn remorselessly entombed alive. Adrastos flying to Athens
              took refuge at the altar of Mercy ; and Theseus leading an Athenian army against the
              Thebans, forced them to give the dead bodies to their friends. As Capaneus lay on his
              burning pyre, his wife Euadne flung herself amidst the flames, and expired.</p>
            <p>Ten years afterwards the children (Ἐ<hi rend="i">πίγονοι, descendents</hi>) of the
              chiefs who had fallen resolved to avenge the fate of their sires<note place="bottom"
                >Il. iv. 405.</note>. The god when consulted promised them victory if led by Alcmæôn
              the son of Amphiaraos. Alemæôn would however first punish his mother ; but Eryphile,
              who had received the robe of Harmonia from Thersandros the son of Polyneices,
              persuaded both him and his brother Amphilochos to join in the expedition. Ægialeus son
              of Adrastos, Diomedes of Tydeus, Promachos of Parthenopæos, Sthenelos of Capaneus,
              Eurypylos of Mecisteus, were the other leaders. Alcmæôn had the chief command<note

            <p>They ravaged the villages about Thebes. A battle ensued, in which Laodamas the son of
              Eteocles slew Ægialeus, and fell himself by the spear of Alcmæôn. The Thebans then
              fled ; and by the advice of Teiresias, they secretly left their city, which was
              entered and plundered by the Argives, and Thersandros placed on the throne.</p>
            <p>Alcmæôn on learning that his mother had taken a bribe against himself, as well as his
              father, consulted Apollo, and by his advice put her to death. He was immediately
              assailed by her Erinnys. In phrenzy he roamed through Arcadia, came first to his
              grandfather Oïcles, and from him went to Phegeus at Psophis, who purified him, and
              gave him his <pb n="481" xml:id="p481"/>daughter Arsinoe in marriage. He presented his
              bride with the fatal collar and robe ; his disorder however still continued, and the
              Pythia said that the Erinnys would never quit him except in a place which the sea had
              disclosed posterior to his parricide<note place="bottom">Paus. viii. 24, 8.</note>. He
              went to Calydôn, thence to Thesprotia, whence he was expelled, and coming to the
              springs of Acheloös was purified by the river-god himself, who gave him to wife his
              daughter Callirrhoe. On the soil just deposited by the stream at its mouth he fixed
              his dwelling<note place="bottom">The Echinades. See Thuc. ii. 102.</note>.</p>
            <p>Callirrhoe now longed for the collar and robe of Harmonia, and refused to admit the
              embraces of her husband until she had obtained them. Alcmæôn returned to Psophis, and
              telling Phegeus that his madness would never end till he had deposited the collar and
              robe at Delphi<note place="bottom"><p>Ephorus (Athen. vi. 232.) says that when Alcmæôn
                  consulted the god about the removal of his insanity, he got the following

                      γῆν αὐτοῖσι σὺν ὅπλοιѕ</l></quote></note>, got them from him ; but his
              servant betraying his secret, the sons of Phegeus by order of their father lay in wait
              for and slew him. Arsinoe on upbraiding them with the murder was put by them into a
              chest and brought to Agapenôr the son of Ancæos, at Tegea, and accused of the crime
              which they had committed.</p>
            <p>When Callirrhoe heard of the fate of her husband, she prayed to Zeus, who had loved
              her, that her sons by Alcmæôn might at once attain to manly age, to avenge their
              father. Her prayer was granted, and they hastened to vengeance. The sons of Phegeus on
              their way to Delphi to consecrate the collar and robe, stopped at the house of
              Agapenôr : here they met the sons of Alcmæôn, who slew them, and then went to Psophis
              and killed Phegeus and his wife. The Psophites pursued them to Tegea ; the Tegeans and
              some Argives aided them, and the Psophites were forced to retire. The youths returned
              to their mother with the collar and robe, which by the direction of Acheloös they
              consecrated at Delphi, and then went to Epeiros, and founded Acarnania.</p>
            <p>In the preceding narrative we have probably the contents <pb n="482" xml:id="p482"
              />of three of the poems of the Epic Cycle, namely the Thebaïs, the Epigoni and the
              Alcmæonis, but intermixed as usual with the arbitrary fictions of the tragedians. The
              wars of Thebes shared in antiquity the popular interest with that of Troy ; and their
              claims to credibility as historic facts are perhaps equally well founded. For our own
              part, as we doubt of the proper historic character of every part of the mythic story
              of Hellas, we feel disposed to view in the destiny of the Labdacids a fine fiction, or
              series of fictions, constructed on perhaps a slight foundation of reality, with a
              moral or religious object ; to show how in the order of nature punishment is provided
              for the most secret and even unconscious violation of its laws, and how the sins of
              the parents are visited on the children, which we must recognise to be a law of
              nature. As usual, the names of the chief persons are significant ; Laïos is the <hi

              conveyed in the failure of the first expedition, led by arrogant boastful chiefs, who
              despised the signs sent by the gods, and the success of that conducted by their more
              pious sons, who acted in obedience to the will of heaven. The story of Alcmæôn is a
              parallel to that of Orestes, perhaps framed in imitation of it ; and, as we may see,
              it is connected with the topography of western Greece.</p>
            <p>The cyclic poems have perished, as also has the Thebaïs of Antimachus ; but the
              Thebaïs of the Latin poet Statius remains, and the prose narratives of Apollodorus,
              Diodorus and Hyginus, beside the scattered notices in the Scholiasts, Pausanias and
              other authors. Of the dramas on this subject there have come down to us the noble
              ‘Seven against Thebes’ of Æschylus, the ‘Œdipûs King,’ ‘Œdipûs at Colonos,’ and

              succeeded to the kingdom, was the most wealthy of men. His three thousand mares and
              their foals fed in the marsh ; and Boreas falling in love with them, changed himself

            <p>Zeus seeing the earth overstocked with people, consulted with Themis how to remedy
              the evil. The best course seeming to be a war between Hellas and Troy, Discord, by his
              direction, came to the banquet of the gods at the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis, and
              flung down a golden apple, inscribed “The apple for the Fair” (Τ<hi rend="i">ῇ καλῇ τὸ

              the judge the beautiful Helena in marriage<note place="bottom">See Il. xxiv.

              announce in vain the woes that are to follow ; the vessel puts to sea, and Alexandros
              arrives at Lacedæmôn, where he is entertained by the Tyndarids. At Sparta he shares
              the hospitality of Menelaos, the husband of Helena. The Trojan at the banquet bestows
              gifts on his fair hostess, and shortly after Menelaos sails to Crete, directing his

              Achilleus being driven to the isle of Scyros, espoused Deïdameia the daughter of <pb

                which at once attracted the attention of Achilleus. This narrative, which is
                directly contrary to that of the Ilias and the Cypria, occurred in the Epic Cycle

              boasted that he was superior in skill to Artemis, and the offended goddess sent
              adverse winds to detain the fleet. Calchos having announced that her wrath could only
              be appeased by the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, the daughter of the offender, that maiden
              was brought to the camp under the pretence of being married to Achilleus. As they were
              in the act of sacrificing her, the goddess moved with pity snatched her away, leaving
              a hind in her place, and carried her to Tauria, where she made her immortal<note
                place="bottom">The name and story of Iphigeneia (<hi rend="i">Strong-born</hi>) are
                unnoticed by Homer. Iphigeneia is probably an epithet of Artemis. She is the same
                with the Artemis- Orthia of Sparta, at whose altar the boys were scourged. It was
                probably this rite that caused Iphigeneia to be identified with the ‘Virgin,’ to
                whom human victims were offered by the Taurians (Herod. iv. 103.). The story of
                Iphigeneia was then invented to account for the similarity. There may however have
                been an ancient Grecian legend of Iphigeneia. See Müller, Dor. i. 397. <hi rend="i"

              here Philoctetes being bitten by a water-snake, the smell from his wound proved so
              offensive, that they carried him to the isle of Lemnos and left him there<note
                place="bottom">See Il. ii. 721.</note>. Achilleus having joined them at Tenedos, a
              quarrel took place between him and Agamemnôn ; but it was made up, and the Achæan host
              passed over to the coast of Troy. The Trojans came to oppose their landing, and
              Protesilaos fell by the hand of Hectôr ; but Achilleus having slain Cycnos the son of
              Poseidôn, put the enemy to flight. An embassy was then sent, requiring the Trojans to
              give back Helena and the property taken with her, but a refusal was returned. An
              assault on the town having failed, the Achæans turned to ravaging the <pb n="488"
                xml:id="p488"/>surrounding country, and took several towns. Soon after Achilleus
              being desirous of seeing Helena, he had an interview with her by means of Thetis and
              Aphrodite ; and when the Achæans had thoughts of giving over the enterprise he
              prevented their departure. He then took some other towns, killed Troïlos, and captured
              and sold for a slave Lycaôn, another of the sons of Priamos. In the division of the
              spoil a maiden named Briseïs fell to the share of Achilleus, and Chryseïs the daughter
              of Chryses, the priest of Apollo, to Agamemnôn. Odysseus, who had long meditated
              vengeance on Palamedes, now carried it into effect ; a forged letter, as from king
              Priamos, was placed in his bed, and he was stoned by the troops as a traitor<note

            <p>Chryses came to the camp to ransom his daughter, but he was driven away with insult
              by Agamemnôn. At his prayer Apollo sent a pestilence among the Achæans. Achilleus
              having called an assembly to inquire into the cause of it, Calchos declared the truth,
              adding that it would not cease till the maiden was restored to her father. Agamemnôn
              expressed his willingness to give her up, but said that some maiden must be given to
              him in her place. A violent dispute between him and Achilleus arises ; the assembly
              breaks up ; Chryseïs is sent back to her father, and the heralds of the king take
              Briseïs away from Achilleus. The injured prince complains to his mother, at whose
              entreaty Zeus promises to punish the Achæans, by giving victory to the Trojans.
              Accordingly Achilleus abstains from war ; and though the Achæans build a wall to
              defend their tents and ships, they are unable to resist Hectôr and the Trojans
              favoured by Zeus. The ships are on the point of being burnt, when Achilleus allows his
              friend Patroclos to lead forth his troops. The Trojans are driven back to their town,
              but Patroclos at last falls by the hand of Hectôr. Rage and grief at the death of his
              friend overcome the wrath of Achilleus. He is reconciled to Agamemnôn ; his mother
              brings him armour made by Hephæstos ; he goes forth to battle, routs the Trojans, and
              slays Hectôr, whose corpse he binds to his chariot, and drags round the <pb n="489"
                xml:id="p489"/>walls of Troy. He then gives a magnificent funeral to Patroclos, and
              on the supplication of the aged Priamos, who comes to his tent by night with a ransom,
              he restores the body of Hector, which the Trojans burn with due solemnity<note

              who struck with her beauty gives her body back to the Trojans that they may perform
              her obsequies. Thersites railing at the hero, as if he had been in love with the
              slain, is killed by him ; this causes a dissension, and Achilleus sails to Lesbos,

              Antilochos the son of Nestôr falls by his hand ; he is himself slain by Achilleus, but
              his mother obtains immortality for him from Zeus. Achilleus chases the Trojans to the
              city, and as he is forcing his way in he is slain by Paris and Apollo. A furious fight
              arises over his body, which Aias at length takes up and carries to the ships, while
              Odysseus keeps off the Trojans. Thetis comes with her sisters and the Muses and mourns
              her son ; she snatches him from the pyre and conveys him to the White Isle. The
              Achæans heap up his mound, games are celebrated, and Thetis proposing his armour as
              the prize of him who had done most to save his corse, Aias and Odysseus contend for

              Zeus. Menelaos kills Deïphobos and leads Helena to the ships. Aias Oïleus seizing
              Cassandra, she grasped the statue of Athena, which he dragged with her ; the Achæans

              disproportionate length. We shall therefore only enumerate the names of the principal
              heroes mentioned by Homer. These were Agamemnôn and Menelaos sons of Atreus (the

              his mother and Ægisthos. The Erinnyes of his mother persecuting him, he fled to
              Delphi, whose god had urged him to commit the deed, and thence went to Athens, where
              he was acquitted by the court of Areiopagos. He took possession of the throne of his
              father, and married Hermione the daughter of Menelaos, by whom he had two sons,
              Tisamenos and Penthilos, who were driven from their country by the Heracleids. Some
              say that Orestes killed at Delphi Neoptolemos the son of Achilleus, to whom Menelaos
              had given Hermione in marriage<note place="bottom">See the tragedians and

            <p>Menelaos stayed at Tenedos after his companions, whom he <pb n="493" xml:id="p493"
              />overtook at Lesbos. He and Nestôr kept company until they reached Cape Sunion in
              Attica. Apollo here slew with his ‘gentle darts’ Phrontis, the pilot of Menelaos’
              ship, who was obliged to stay to bury him. Having performed the due rites, he again
              put to sea ; but as he approached Cape Maleia, Zeus sent forth a storm which drove
              some of his vessels to Crete, where they went to pieces against the rocks. Five, on
              board of one of which was Menelaos himself, were carried by the wind and waves to
                Egypt<note place="bottom">Od. iii. 276. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>During the eight years of his absence Menelaos visited all the adjacent coasts,

                all the eastern as Odysseus did all the western part of the Mediterrauean. Libya

              wealth ; but leaving Egypt on his voyage homewards, he neglected offering sacrifices
              to the gods, and was in consequence detained by want of wind at the isle of Pharos,
              which was distant from Egypt a day's sail of a ship with a favouring breeze. They were
              here twenty days : their stock of provisions was nearly run out, and they were obliged
              to pass the day in endeavouring to catch fish to support them ; when the sea-nymph
              Eidothea the daughter of Proteus met Menelaos wandering alone, and informed him how to
              catch her father, and learn from him what he was to do. Menelaos followed her
              directions ; and by the advice of the old sea-god<note place="bottom">See above,
                p. 247.</note> he returned to the river Ægyptos, and there offered due sacrifices to
              the immortal gods. A favourable wind was then sent by them, which speedily carried him
              homewards ; and he arrived in his native country on the very day that Orestes was
              giving the funeral feast for his mother and Ægisthos, whom he had slain<note
                place="bottom">Od. iv. 351. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>Helena was, according to Homer, the companion of all the wanderings of Menelaos ; but
              the Egyptian priests pretended <pb n="494" xml:id="p494"/>that Paris was driven by
              adverse winds to Egypt, where Proteus, who was then king, learning the truth, kept
              Helena and dismissed Paris ; that the Greeks would not believe the Trojans, that she
              was not in their c ity, till they had taken it ; and that then Menelaos sailed to
              Egypt, where his wife was restored to him<note place="bottom">Herod. ii. 113 — 121.
                The fiction was as old as the time of Stesichorus, who said that Proteus gave Paris

                ‘Helena’ follows this account.</note>.</p>
            <p>Odysseus sailed with the part of the army which left Agamemnôn as far as Tenedos ;
              but he there quitted them and returned to the king<note place="bottom">Od. iii.

              where his men took and burned the town of Ismaros ; but delaying on the coast and
              feasting, they were attacked by the Ciconians and driven to their ships, with the loss
              of six men out of each. Sailing thence they were assailed by a storm, from which they
              were obliged to seek refuge on shore. On the third day, the weather clearing, they put
              again to sea, and had a prosperous voyage till they were doubling Cape Maleia, when a
              violent north-east wind arose, and carried them to the country of the
              Lotus-eaters.</p>

              sailors departed, leaving him, who was asleep, with his wealth on the shore. On
              awaking he was informed by Athena where he was ; and going to the house of his
              swineherd Eumæos, there met and revealed himself to his son Telemachos. After a
              variety of adventures, he succeeded in killing the princes who wooed his chaste spouse
              Penelope and wasted his substance<note place="bottom">The Odyssey ends here ; in the

              Callidice. Heading her subjects in a war against the Brygians, he was opposed by Ares
              and aided by Athena, and Apollo interfered to terminate the contest. After the death
              of Callidice Odysseus gave the kingdom to his son by her, named Polypœtes, and
              returned to Ithaca. Soon after, Telegonos, his son by Circe, coming in quest of him,
              landed and began to plunder the isle, and Odysseus going to oppose him fell by his
                hand<note place="bottom">In our remarks on the story of Soohrâb in the ‘Tales and

                Sophocles was the death of a son of Odysseus, whose birth was somewhat like that of
                Soohrâb, and who was sent in quest of him by his mother, and through the artifice of
                Penelope falls by his hands. Parthen. Erot. 3.</note>. Telegonos, on learning whom
              he had unwittingly slain, took Penelope and Telemachos and the body of his father with
              him to his mother's isle. Circe there made them immortal, and she herself married
              Telemachos, and Penelope became the bride of Telegonos.</p>
            <p>The literature of the Trojan war was very copious. Of the original poems the Ilias
              and Odyssey alone have come down to us ; fragments only exist of the remaining parts
              of the Cycle ; to judge by those of the Cypria it must have been a very beautiful
              poem ; those of the others are too scanty to enable us to form an opinion of their
              merit. The brief abstract of their contents given above is derived from two fragments
              of the Chrestomathy of Proclus, of which the one, containing the epitome of the
              Cypria, was discovered by Tychsen in a manuscript of the Ilias in the library of the
              Escurial, the other, containing the remainder, by Siebenkees in a manuscript Homer at
              Venice. It is by these fragments that critics have been able to ascertain what the
              Epic Cycle really was.</p>
            <p>The Cycle, as we have observed, existed long after the commencement of the Christian
              æra, and various poems appear to have been made from it. That of Quintus Smyrnæus in
              fourteen books, contains the narrative from the end of the Ilias <pb n="496"
                xml:id="p496"/>to the taking of Troy, which last event is the subject of the poem of
              Tryphiodorus, while Coluthus sang the abduction of Helena, and Tzetzes in three books
              put into verse the events before, in, and after the Ilias. To these later times also
              belong the tasteless pragmatised narratives in prose ascribed to Dictys of Crete, and
              Dares the Phrygian, two notorious forgeries. Much matter relating to the war of Troy
              will be found in Eudocia and the scholiasts, and in the Latin Hyginus.</p>
            <p>Æschylus’ magnificent trilogy, the Oresteia, consisting of the Agamemnôn, the
              Choëphoræ, and the Eumenides, is the only portion of his works on this subject which
              has reached us ; of Sophocles we have the Philoctetes, Ajax and Electra, and of
              Euripides the Hecuba, Troades, Andromache, Helena, Electra and Orestes ; we have also
              the Rhesus of another poet. The Cassandra of Lycophrôn with the notes of the Tzetzes
              contains much Troïc matter. Ovid gives the war a place in his Metamorphoses, and
              Statius has left an imperfect poem on the subject of Achilleus.</p>
            <p>Having arrived at the closing event of the Grecian mythology, we will now briefly
              consider the question of its reality. Of the number of ships and warriors before Troy
              we shall say nothing, it being the palpable exaggeration of national and local vanity.
              Who could believe, for example, that Athens, in a quarrel not her own, sent to the
              coast of Asia, there to remain for ten years, a force the one half of that which she
              opposed to the Barbarians when fighting for her existence<note place="bottom">The
                Catalogue gives the Athenians fifty ships. But what is this to the ninety of
                Pylos ?</note> at Marathôn ? The question is, did a confederated Hellenic army
              actually invade and conquer a powerful realm on the coast of Asia ?</p>
            <p>To this we are inclined to answer in the negative. We have seen the personages and
              events of Grecian mythology gradually dissolve into air as we approached them, at
              times however showing a slight substratum of reality which gave them support. Such was
              the voyage of the Argonauts ; such too <pb n="497" xml:id="p497"/>we think was the war
              of ‘Troy divine.’ As the former rested on the voyages of the Minyans, so the latter
              had its origin in the early settlements of the Greeks on the coast of Asia and the
              contests they had to sustain with the original owners of the soil. These settlements
              were probably long before the time of the Dorian Migration ; for we must not give
              implicit credit to what is called the early Grecian history, which is nothing but a
              scientific product from epic poems and local traditions<note place="bottom">See
                Buttmann, Mytholog. ii. 184. 210.</note>. We have before noticed the Grecian habit
              of supposing that their gods or heroes had already visited or conquered the country
              which they themselves had acquired, and supposing therefore Achæans from the
              Peloponnese to have conquered a tract about the Hellespont, they may easily have
              conceived that the great hero of Argos, Heracles, had done the same, or that a monarch
              of Argos had led a host thither and taken and plundered a large city. This may have
              been at first a simple tradition ; it may have been then expanded in ballads ; the
              number of warriors have been increased as colonists from other parts of Hellas came to
              partake in them ; the artificial mounds which lie scattered over the plain, the tombs
              probably of princes and warriors of an extinct race, have been regarded as those of
              Trojan and Achæan chiefs<note place="bottom">See Ritter, Vorhalle, &amp;c. p. 248. <hi
                  rend="i">seq.</hi> There are six of them marked on Gell’s map of the
              Troas.</note> ; and thus the war may have finally acquired the magnitude and
              importance which it displays in the Ilias.</p>
            <p>A cause for this war was to be assigned, and the manners of the age may have
              suggested that of the abduction of a Grecian princess<note place="bottom">Payne Knight
                (Proleg. § 54.) finds the cause in the great magnitudes of the empires of Agamemnôn
                and Priamos, and thence their mutual jealousy. He also supposes the Pelopids to have
                meditated the recovery of the dominion of which the Dardanids had deprived
                Tantalos.</note>. But we have shown that the person selected is a purely imaginary
              being, a mere personification of the moon. Other names indicate ideal personages
              also : those of Agamemnôn and Menelaos appear to denote the <hi rend="i">long
                stay</hi> of the army before Troy ; Odysseus is apparently the <hi rend="i"
                >Wanderer</hi> ; while Achilleus, Nestôr, and others are merely the heroes of
              different parts of Hellas introduced into the cycle of the Trojan <pb n="498"
                xml:id="p498"/>war. Again, when we find the Greeks at war with any real people, we
              may observe that the names of the adverse leaders have no similarity to Grecian ones ;
              but all those of the Trojans and their allies are if possible more Greek than those of
              some of the Achæan chiefs. Such are Deïphobos, Antenôr, Alexandros, Andromache ;
              Hectôr plainly signifies the <hi rend="i">defender</hi> (<hi rend="i">ἔχω</hi>),
              equivalent to that of his son Astyanax<note place="bottom">“Ο<hi rend="i">ἷos γàρ

                Plato Cratyl. 394. Welcker, Tril. 288.</note> ; the leaders of the people of the <hi
                rend="i">far-off</hi> Alybe are named Odios and Epistrophos. It is thus that
              significant names are given to the Centaurs, the Amazons, and above all to that
              beautiful poetic creation, the Phæacians.</p>
            <p>The union for a common object ascribed to the Greeks in this mythe is totally
              repugnant to their natural character ; even the invasion of Xerxes failed to unite
              them. The length of the war too is incredible ; no volunteer army would ever have
              remained so long absent from their homes and families. We very much doubt if the
              war-car ever was used in Greece, as no vestige of such a custom was to be found in the
              historic times. It is not unlikely that this Asiatic usage was transferred by the
              poets to the mythic ages of Hellas. We could make many more objections than these, but
              we will abstain, as it is probable that our scepticism may only serve to alienate some
              of our readers. Our conviction however is, that the siege of Troy is little more real
              than that of Albracca, of which ‘romances tell<note place="bottom">Most of the
                objections here urged will be found in Bryant’s ‘Dissertation on the War of Troy,’
                an essay which we had not read when the above was written.</note>.’</p>
            <p>The War of Troy and the Returns terminate the mythic history of Greece. The Dorian
              Migration, or Return of the Heracleids, though greatly mingled with fable, is a real
              event. For some centuries the history of Greece is semi-mythic ; such is the form of
              even the Persian war. After that it is related by contemporary writers, and becomes as
              true as that of any other people.</p>
            <p>We have thus seen that the heroes, like the gods, of Greece were the pure creations
              of imagination. At the waving of the <pb n="499" xml:id="p499"/>mythologie wand they
              have all melted into air, and Grecian history appears to us emerging from a kind of
              fairy-land. This is in our eyes a beautiful prospect. No one can believe the mythes in
              their present form ; and nothing can be more dry and insipid than the manner in which
              the pragmatisers seek to convert them into real history. Yet in the carlier and better
              days of Greece they were undoubted articles of actual belief ; and Hesiod probably
              gave no more than the popular creed when he said of the heroes,</p>

                    have believed them to be true. Anaxagoras and other early philosophers regarded
                    even the Ilias as an ethic allegory ; but this was a mistaken view. Single
                    mythes, such as those of Ixiôn and Tantalos, certainly were such. It is possible
                    that the Isles of the Blest, exclusively reserved for the Heroes, were a fiction
                    similar to the Isle of Venus of Camôes (one of the most beautiful creations of
                    modern genius), which he assures us was an allegory. The original lines are so
                    fine, that we cannot refrain from quoting some of them.</p><quote><l>Que as

              satisfactorily ascertained, than that of Italy having been long before the foundation
              of Rome a highly populous and industriously cultivated region. But all records of
              those times, if such did ever exist, are lost never to be recovered ; and it is only
              from the remains of their operations on the solid surface of the earth — their
              gigantic buildings, lakes, and canals — that we are left to conjecture the state of
              the ancient inhabitants of Italy<note place="bottom">Niebuhr's Hist. of Rome, i. 170.
                  <hi rend="i">seq.</hi></note>.</p>
            <p>In the times of the early history of Rome, three principal nations possessed the
              central part of the Peninsula. These were the Etruscans, the Latins, and the
              Sabellians. The city of Rome, whose origin is involved in such obscurity, rose on the
              confines of these three nations : her population was formed out of them : she derived
              from them all her institutions ; and among others her religious doctrines and rites,
              which she moulded and mingled in such a manner as to make it now nearly impossible to
              assign with certainty to each its part in the combined whole which Roman story
              displays.</p>
            <p>Popular poetry is, as the example of ancient Greece shows, the great preserver of the
              popular religion in a society where it is of a complex and varied nature. That of
              Greece teemed with legends of the adventures of its gods ; each of which became the
              theme of popular verse, passed from mouth to mouth, was sung at the festivals of the
              deity whose acts it recorded, <pb n="502" xml:id="p502"/>was varied, changed, and
              modified by the narrators ; and when at length, by opening an intercourse with Egypt,
              Greece obtained, in the papyrus, the means of preserving her literature, numbers of
              these legends were secured from the weakness and defects of the memory. Thousands of
              others still floated about, and were gradually sunk in the stream of oblivion.</p>
            <p>But in Italy the case was different : the people of this country seem not to have
              possessed the lively fancy and ready invention of the natives of Hellas. Their
              religion was, as far as we can discern, of a more serious character ; no wars or
              crimes polluted the beings whom they adored ; and the virtue of the Italian maids and
              matrons was safe from the lust of the gods who ruled over mankind<note place="bottom"
                >See the praises which Dionysius (Antiq. Rom. i. 18, 19.) bestows on this account on
                the religion of the Romans, which we may observe had no deity answering to the Erôs
                of the Grecks. In our observations above we include all the religions of Italy ; and
                we allude to the Hellenic, not the Pelasgian form, of the Grecian mythes. In their
                original and true sense they were, as we have seen, perfectly pure and
              moral.</note>. Hence the most fruitful source of Grecian legend was wanting in Italy ;
              and the poet, when he would raise a hymn to accompany the sacrifice to a god, could
              only, like a Christian bard, extol his goodness and implore his favour. When,
              therefore, the papyrus made its way to Italy, though it might have found numerous
              ballads in praise of illustrious men, and hymns in honour of the gods to record, it
              met no love-adventures of the latter to impress on its pages. The cause of this
              character of the Italian religion it is scarcely possible to assign ; even at the
              present day Italy yields to Spain in the number, variety and poetic character of the
              legends of the lives and miracles of the Saints, as she did to Hellas in the mythes of
              gods and heroes<note place="bottom">In like manner Spain is much richer in romances of
                chivalry.</note>.</p>
            <p>Beside the religious systems and deities of the three nations above enumerated which
              Rome adopted, she early, — even in the regal period, — began, with that facility which
              always distinguished her, to appropriate the gods of Greece. Her knowledge of them
              was, it is probable, chiefly derived from the Grecian colonies in Italy ; from whom
              she also obtained those oracles called the Sibylline Books, which are known to have
                <pb n="503" xml:id="p503"/>been Greek, and which always enjoined the adoption of
              Grecian rites and Grecian deities.</p>
            <p>When her arms had penetrated to the south of the Peninsula, and the cities of Magna
              Græcia acknowledged her dominion, poets of this country sought the favour of the
              Mistress of Italy, by celebrating her origin and her deeds in her own language. Nævius
              the Campanian sang, in Saturnian verse, (the ancient measure of Italian poetry,) the
              chief events from the voyage of Æneas to the end of the first Punic war. The Calabrian
              Ennius boldly and contemptuously sought to banish the rude free form of measure in
              which the Romans at their banquets sang the deeds of their fathers, and digested in
              Grecian hexameters the events which it recorded into his Annals. Grecian forms now
              supplanted all the old Italian ones : Grecian mythology, with all its legends, was
              rapidly poured in upon Rome. Each succeeding age saw the Græco-mania increase : the
              people of education looked with contempt on the rude lays of their forefathers and
              their simpler religion ; the homely old ballads of the Cossi and Cethegi fell into
              oblivion ; the entire literature of Rome became Grecian ; and the extant Roman poetry
              is little more than a transcript of that of Greece.</p>
            <p>Italian mythes, as has been observed, do not exist. In Virgil and Ovid we meet a few
              adventures of the old Italian deities framed in imitation of those of Greece, but
              totally repugnant to the religious ideas of Italy. For our knowledge of the objects of
              Italian worship we are chiefly indebted to these poets, and to Varro, Gellius,
              Macrobius, and the Latin Fathers of the Church. In all of them we discern the
              influence of the principles of Euhemerus introduced into Rome by Ennius.</p>

            <head><hi rend="i">The Etruscan Religion.</hi></head>
            <p>The disposition of the Etruscans was melancholy and serious ; their form of
              government a rigid aristocracy, administered by an hereditary race or caste of
              priestly nobility. Their religion was founded on peculiar views of the world and its
              periods, and the art of learning the will of the supernal powers by the thunder, the
              lightning, and other aërial <pb n="504" xml:id="p504"/>phænomena. The rules and
              principles of this science were contained in books ascribed to a subterranean dæmon
              named Tages, who, the Tuscan legend said, had risen up, a babe in form, an aged man in
              wisdom, from under the soil before the plough of a peasant of Tarquinii as he was at
              his work, and who instructed the people in divination<note place="bottom">Cic. De Div.
                ii. 23. Ovid ; Met. xv. 558. Joh. Lydus, De Ostentis, iii.</note>.</p>
            <p>According to the doctrine of the Etruscans there were two orders of gods, the one
              superior, <hi rend="i">veiled</hi> and nameless, with whom the supreme god took
              counsel when about to announce by lightning any change in the present order of
                things<note place="bottom">Seneca, Qu. Nat. ii. 41. Festus <hi rend="i">v.</hi>
                Manubiæ.</note>. The other consisted of twelve gods, six male and as many female,
              his ordinary council. These were called by the common name of <hi rend="i"
                >Consentes</hi> or <hi rend="i">Complices</hi> (the Latin of the Etruscan word),
              according to Varro<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Ap.</hi> Arnob. iii. 123.</note>
              because they are born and die together. The general Etruscan term for a god was
                Æsar<note place="bottom">Suetonius, Octav. 97. Dion. Cass. lvi. 29.</note>.</p>
            <p>The supreme god of the Tuscans, answering to the Zeus of the Greeks, the Jupiter of
              the Romans, was named Tina<note place="bottom">Said to be a corruption of Ζ<hi
                  rend="i">ῆνα</hi></note>. A goddess named Kupra was called by the Romans Juno ;
              and another, named Menerfa or Menrfa, was the original of the Minerva of Rome. These
              three deities had always contiguous temples on the citadel of every Etruscan city<note
                place="bottom">Serv. Æn. i. 422.</note>. Hence the united temples of Jupiter, Juno,
              and Minerva, which crowned the Capitol at Rome.</p>
            <p>A goddess named Nortia, answering to the Roman Fortuna, was worshiped at the Tuscan
              cities of Sutri and Vulsinii<note place="bottom">Livy, vii. 3. Juvenal, x. 74. Tertul.
                Apol. 24.</note>. Vertumnus also was one of the principal deities of Etruria<note
                place="bottom">Varro, L. L. iv. p. 14. (Bip.)</note>. The Tuscan god of the
              under-world was named Mantus<note place="bottom">Serv. Æn. x. 199.</note>, and there
              was a goddess of it called Mania. The Lars, which form so conspicuous a portion of the
              Roman religion, it is probable belonged originally to the Etruscan system.</p>
            <p>The Etruscans had also deities answering to the Neptunus, Mars, Saturnus, Janus,
              Vulcanus, Summanus, Vejovis and others of the Romans. Nine were held to have the power
              of <pb n="505" xml:id="p505"/>casting the lightning, namely, Jupiter, Juno, Minerva,
              Vejovis, Summanus, Vulcanus, Saturnus, Mars. It is uncertain who was the ninth.</p>
            <p>As soon as an intercourse was opened between Etruria and Greece or her colonies, the
              Grecian mythology made most rapid progress in that country ; and the deities and
              legends of Greece became so closely interwoven in the system of Etruria, that it is
              with difficulty any vestiges of the original domestic system can be traced<note
                place="bottom">On the Tuscan religion and deities see Müller's Etrusker, Buch
                iii.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Romans, previous to their acquaintance with Greece, always looked up to Etruria
              as their instructress. The patrician children were sent thither for education ; all
              the royal and consular ornaments were borrowed from that country ; and the science and
              the religious ceremonies of Rome were almost entirely derived from Etruria.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <head><hi rend="i">The Latin Religion.</hi></head>
            <p>Late writers have made it extremely probable that the Latins were a mixed people,
              formed out of the aboriginal inhabitants of the country, and the Pelasgians, that
              extensive race which originally possessed Greece and a portion of Lesser Asia. This is
              perhaps the best principle on which the great similarity of the Latin and Greek
              languages can be accounted for ; and it will also in a great measure, taken however in
              combination with the general one, explain the agreement of their religious systems,
              and the facility with which the religion and mythology of Greece were adopted at
              Rome.</p>
            <p>It cannot be determined which of the Roman gods are to be regarded as those of their
              Latin forefathers ; but it is probable that Saturnus, Ops, Janus, Jana, Pales, Pomona,
              and those deities relating to agriculture (to which the Latins were greatly devoted),
              were derived by the Romans from their Latin forefathers. We shall perhaps not err if
              we regard as Latin all those deities whose Sabine or Etruscan origin does not
              appear.</p>

              <hi rend="i">The Sabellian Religion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Under the name of Sabellians may be comprised all the tribes of the Apennines east of
              Latium. It is therefore inclusive of the Sabines, Samnites, Marsians, and their
              kindred clans ; and it is by no means improbable, that the Umbrians to the north and
              the Oscans to the south of them were of the same race with the Sabellians.</p>
            <p>The rigid virtues of a portion of the Sabellian race, particularly the Sabines, were
              always the theme of praise at Rome. Grazing and agriculture were the chief employments
              of these hardy tribes, and their religion was intimately connected with these arts ;
              and consequently, we may suppose, bore much resemblance to that of the Latins. It has
              always been asserted that a great portion of the Roman religion was of Sabine
              origin.</p>
            <p>The Sabines adored Sancus and Sabus, or Sabinus, as the origins of their nation<note
                place="bottom">Sil. Ital. viii. 422. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Virg. Æn. vii.
                178.</note>. Mamers or Mars was also one of their deities ; an erect lance was the
              symbol before which he was worshiped. According to the ancient Annals of Rome<note
                place="bottom">Varro, L. L. p. 22. (Bip.)</note> Tatius the Sabine king raised
              altars to Ops and Flora, Diovis and Saturnus, Sol and Luna, Vulcanus and Summanus, and
              to Larunda, Terminus, Quirinus, Vortumnus, the Lars, Diana and Cloacina.</p>
            <p>The Marsian portion of this race were as remarkable for their skill in detecting the
              will of the gods in the flight and voice of the birds, as the Etruscans for discerning
              it in the electric phænomena of the sky.</p>
            <p>It is a very remarkable feature in the ancient religion of Italy, that though it
              admitted not of the births, marriages and generations of its deities, like that of
              Greece, it usually represented them in pairs, each consisting of a male and a female
                divinity<note place="bottom">“Duplicis sexus numina esse dicuntur, ut cum in actu
                sunt mares sint, feminæ cum patiendi habent naturam.” — Serv. Æn. iv. 638.</note>.
              Thus we meet with Saturnus and Ops, <pb n="507" xml:id="p507"/>Saturnus and Lua, Mars
              and Neriene, Quirinus and Hora. In some cases the name of the goddess is only the
              feminine form of that of the god, as Janus Jana, Tellumo Tellus, Lupercus Luperca,
              Volumnus Volumna, Vitellius Vitellia. This principle probably ran through the whole of
              the ancient language, for we find <hi rend="i">animus</hi> and <hi rend="i">anima</hi>
              used of the vital powers, and Rome and other Italian towns politically divided into a
                <hi rend="i">Populus</hi> and a <hi rend="i">Plebes</hi><note place="bottom">See
                Niebuhr, Hist. of Rome, i. 417.</note>.</p>
            <p>Another peculiar feature of the old Italian religion, and which testifies for its
              purity, warmth and simplicity, is that of calling the gods Fathers (<hi rend="i"
                >Patres</hi>), and the goddesses Mothers (<hi rend="i">Matres</hi>), — titles of
              veneration or affection given by the Greeks to none but Zeus and Demeter or Earth. As
              this is a circumstance that seems to have almost totally escaped the notice of modern
              inquirers, we will here give some proofs of such being the usage among the Romans.</p>
            <p>Cicero, when laying down laws for his ideal republic, says<note place="bottom">Laws,
                ii. 10.</note>, “<hi rend="i">Patrum</hi> delubra esse in urbibus censeo ;” and that
              by <hi rend="i">patres</hi> he means the gods, is evident from what follows ; for he
              proceeds, “I do not follow the Persian Magi, at whose impulsion Xerxes is said to have
              burnt the temples in Greece, because they shut up within walls the gods, to whom all
              should be free and open, and whose house and temple this whole world should be.” In
              the ‘Council of the Gods’ of the old satirist Lucilius were the following lines<note
                place="bottom"><hi rend="i">Ap.</hi> Lactant. Div. Inst. iv. 3.</note> :</p>
            <quote>
              <l>Ut nemo sit nostrum quin pater optimus Divum,</l>
              <l>Ut Neptunus pater, Liber, Saturnus pater, Mars,</l>
              <l>Janus, Quirinus pater nomen dicatur ad unum ;</l>
            </quote>
            <p rend="noindent">on which Lactantius observes, that “every god who is worshiped by man
              must in solemn rites and prayers be called Father, not only for the sake of honour but
              from reason, both because he was before man, and because like a father he gives life,
              health and food.” To this we may add the testimony of Servius, who says<note
                place="bottom">Æn. i. 155.</note> that “the ancients called all the gods fathers.”
              We have not the same direct evidence of the goddesses being called mothers<note
                place="bottom">Varro however says (Fr. p. 222. Bip.), “Diis quibusdam patribus et
                deabus matribus, sicut hominibus, ignobilitatem accidisse.”</note>, but we will show
              by induction <pb n="508" xml:id="p508"/>that such was the case. As Lactantius
              observes, it was chiefly in prayer that the terms Father and Mother were used ; but
              they adhered to some of the gods, such as Jupiter. Liber does not often occur without
              a <hi rend="i">pater</hi> ; neither does Dis ; and we usually meet Mater Matuta.</p>
            <p>The Romans were fond of using their political vocabulary, even when speaking of their
              gods. Thus we read of gods of the Greater Houses<note place="bottom">Cicero, Tusc. i.
                13.</note>, the Ramnes and Titienses, as it were, of heaven ; and of the Select
                Gods<note place="bottom">Varro, Fr. p. 223. (Bip.)</note>, like the Select Judges ;

                173. Ibis 81.</note>. It cannot perhaps be asserted that these divisions were made
              seriously, or were used by the hierarchy ; but Varro<note place="bottom"><hi rend="i"
                  >Ut supra.</hi></note> gives the names of twenty Select Gods ; and there stood in

                place="bottom">Varro, L. L. iv. p. 20. Gellius, v. 12.</note>, and Jovis Pater
              became Jupiter, answering to the Ζ<hi rend="i">ϵὺς πατὴρ</hi> of the Greeks. In the
              more ancient monuments of the Roman religion Jovis or Jupiter does not occur
              unaccompanied by an epithet.</p>
            <p>The principal Jupiter was the Capitoline, or the Jupiter Optimus Maximus, whose
              temple combined with those of Juno and Minerva adorned the Capitol in Rome, and who
              was regarded as the great guardian of the fortune of the city.</p>
            <p>Jupiter Elicius was so named, as we are told, from the following circumstance<note
                place="bottom">Ovid, Fasti, iii. 285. <hi rend="i">seq.</hi> Plut. Numa, 15.</note>.
              In the time of Numa there occurred great thunder-storms and rain. The people and their
              king were terrified, and the latter had recourse to the counsel of the nymph Egeria.
              She informed him that Faunus and Picus could instruct him in the mode of appeasing
              Jupiter, but that he must employ both art and violence to extract the knowledge from
              them. Accordingly by her advice he placed bowls of wine at a fountain on Mount
              Aventine, whither they were wont to come to drink, and concealed himself in a
              neighbouring cavern. The <pb n="510" xml:id="p510"/>rural gods came to the fount, and
              finding the wine drank copiously of it : they immediately afterwards fell asleep, and
              Numa quitting his retreat came and bound them. On awaking, they struggled, but in
              vain, to get free ; and the pious prince, apologising for what necessity had obliged
              him to do, entreated that they would inform him how Jupiter was to be appeased. They
              yielded to his prayer, and on his loosing them drew down (“<hi rend="i"
              >eliciunt</hi>”) Jupiter by their charms. He descended on the Aventine hill, which
              trembled beneath the weight of the deity. Numa was terrified, but recovering he
              implored the god to give a remedy against the lightning. The ruler of the thunder
              assented, and in ambiguous terms conveyed the relief : “Cut a head” — “of an onion
              from my garden” subjoined the king, — “of a man” — “the topmost hairs” quickly replied
              Numa ; — “I demand a life” — “of a fish.” The deity smiled, and said that his weapons
              might thus be averted, and promised a sign at sun-rise the following morning.</p>
            <p>At dawn the people assembled before the doors of the king : Numa came forth, and
              seated on his maple throne looked for the rising of the sun. The orb of day was just
              wholly emerged above the horizon, when a loud crash was heard in the sky : thrice the
              god thundered, without a cloud ; thrice he sent forth his lightnings. The heavens
              opened, and a light buckler came gently wafted on the air and fell to the ground. Numa
              having first slain a heifer, took it up and named it Ancile. He regarded it as the
              pledge of empire ; and having had eleven others made exactly like it by the artist
              Mamurius, to deceive those who might attempt to steal it, committed them to the care
              of the priests named Salians.</p>
            <p>As Latiaris or <hi rend="i">Of-the-Latins</hi>, Jupiter was annually worshiped by the
              Latins on the Alban Mount. The festival was named the Latin Holidays (<hi rend="i"
                >Feriæ</hi>) ; its institution was ascribed to Tarquinius Superbus. Jupiter Anxur
              was the chief deity of Anxur or Tarracina. Jupiter Indiges was worshiped on the banks
              of the Numicius, and was said to be the deified Æneas.</p>
            <p>Jupiter was named Feretrius or <hi rend="i">Bearer</hi>, as the spoils of the enemy's
              general if slain by a Roman commander were <hi rend="i">borne</hi> to him. He was also
              called Victor and Stator, as the giver of victory and stayer of flight. We also meet
              with Jupiter <pb n="511" xml:id="p511"/>Pistor, whose altar was on the Capitol<note

            <p>Minerva, or Menerva, corresponded in some measure with the Pallas-Athene of the

            <p>The festivals of Minerva were named Minervalia or Quinquatrus. They were two in

                >Serv. Æn. xi. 259.</note>. It was named Quinquatrus as being on the fifth day after
              the Ides<note place="bottom">Varro, L. L. v. p. 55.</note> : the ignorance of the
              Romans made them extend the festival to five days ; it was followed by the
                Tubilustrum<note place="bottom">Ovid, Fasti, iii. 849. Varro, <hi rend="i">ut

              Romans of Tatius and Romulus were reconciled, they purified themselves on the spot
              with myrtle-vervain, and a statue to Venus Cluacina was afterwards erected there.
              Another account<note place="bottom">Lactant. i. 20.</note> says, that a statue of an
              unknown deity being found in the Cloaca, it was consecrated to Venus, under the name
              of Cloacina.</p>
            <pb n="516" xml:id="p516"/><p>There was at Rome a temple of Venus Fruti<note
                place="bottom">Festus <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Frutinal.</note>, which last seems to be
              merely a corruption of Aphrodite. It may however be connected with <hi rend="i"
                >fructus</hi>, and refer to her rural character. In the Circus stood a chapel of
              Venus Murtia, so named it is said from the myrtles which had grown there<note
                place="bottom">Varro, L. L. iv. p. 43. It was afterwards corrupted to Murcia (Plin.
                  <hi rend="i">ut supra</hi>) and derived from <hi rend="i">murcidum</hi>, “quia
                facit hominem murcidum, id est nimis desidiosum.”Aug. Civ. Dei, iv. 16.</note>.</p>
            <p>At Lavinium there was a temple of Venus common to the Latin nation, and there was
              another similar temple at Ardea<note place="bottom">Strabo, v. 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>There were two festivals at Rome named Vinalia, in each of which there appears to
              have been a reference to this goddess. The first was on the 23rd of April, the second
              day from the Palilia. The offering was made to Jupiter, but the day was also sacred to
                Venus<note place="bottom">Plin. H. N. xviii. 29. Ovid, Fast. iv. 863. with our
                notes.</note>. Ovid directs the <hi rend="i">meretrices</hi> to go and worship on
              this day at the temple of Venus Erycina near the Colline gate, whence we may collect
              that such was their practice ; and we have here a proof of the identification of the
              Roman deity with those of other religions, for that Venus was the Phœnician Astarte.
              The second Vinalia, called the Rustica, was on the 21st of August ; and here we find
              Jupiter and Venus again united, for on this day the Flamen Dialis, having first
              sacrificed a ewe-lamb, himself commenced gathering the grapes ; and the gardeners kept
              it as a holiday, for we are told that “a temple was dedicated to Venus on this day,
              and gardens are placed under her protection<note place="bottom">Varro, L. L. v.
                pp. 56. 57. Festus <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Rustica Vinalia.</note>.”</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may form a presumption in favour of the original rural character of Venus,
              that, like Pales, her name is of both genders. Thus we meet with <hi rend="i"
                >Deus</hi> and <hi rend="i">Dea</hi> Venus, and with Venus <hi rend="i">almus</hi>,
              and Venus <hi rend="i">alma.</hi><note place="bottom">Macrobius (Sat. iii. 8.) gives
                the following passages, “Pollentemque deum Venerem.” — Calvus. “Venerem igitur almum
                adorans, sive femina sive mas est.” — Lævinus. He also quotes “Descendo ac ducente
                deo,” Virg. Æn. ii. 632. on which see Servius.</note>. The name Venus, or rather
              Veneris, may, as was supposed, come from <hi rend="i">venio</hi>, but its origin is
              very doubtful.</p>
